"""fw_vectors.py — golden vectors for a *firmware* kernel, from its command trace.

The `gen_vectors.py` of the CPU producer, and the last piece of phase 3
(`accel/tpu/docs/picorv32_migration.md` §8). Where `gen_vectors.py` assembles a
`.tpu` program and runs it through `iss.py`'s instruction decoder, this reads the
command trace a natively-compiled firmware kernel emitted and runs it through
`iss.py`'s *command* decoder — the same op bodies underneath, so the two paths
cannot disagree about numerics without disagreeing everywhere.

    make -C ../tpu/fw trace > matmul.trace.txt
    python fw_vectors.py -t matmul.trace.txt -o ../tpu/tb/vectors_fw

Three files come out, all `$readmemh`-able:

    fw_dram_in.hex    the operand image the testbench seeds DRAM with
    fw_dram_exp.hex   every DRAM byte the run wrote, and what it should be
    fw_cmds.hex       the expected command trace: 5 words per command
                      (unit, w0, w1, w2, w3), terminated by a 0xFFFFFFFF unit

The third is what makes this more than a rewrite of the old inline checks. The
testbench monitors the arbitrated command write inside `tpu_top` and diffs the
real PicoRV32's command stream against this one, so a failure says *which
command* diverged rather than only that the answer was wrong — which is the
capability the abandoned RV32IM interpreter was really being bought for
(§8.1).

**The operand formulas live here and nowhere else.** They used to be duplicated
between `fw_matmul_tb.sv` and `host/run_fw_matmul.py`, which is exactly the
drift this phase exists to remove.

    compute what the ISS says — and tying it to an untracked `.pt` would make it
    unrunnable the moment the model is retrained. `adder_export.py` stages the
    real thing into this same map.

    The map is adder.c's, and this is the only other place it is written down:

        0x00000 X0     [T][D]   int8    0x00800 mask  [T][T]  int8

    answer rather than as a coincidentally equal one, and the padding columns of
    W_fc carry **live** weights: staged as zeros they would agree with a kernel
    that strided its second output tile wrongly, because both would be zero.

    The weights come from :func:`w_hash` rather than the `(a*r + b*c) % 16`
    pattern the smaller kernels use: `c*b mod 16` has a period dividing 16, so a
    linear pattern makes blocks that differ only by a multiple-of-16 column
    offset bit-identical — and the four [D][D] projections here are exactly that
    kind of neighbour, which would make an addressing bug between them
    invisible.
