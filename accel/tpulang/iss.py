"""iss.py — instruction-set simulator for the TPU scalar ISA.

Executes the 32-bit machine words produced by ``assembler.py`` against a model
of the scratchpad plus the MXU/VPU compute units, matching the RTL in
``accel/tpu/rtl/*.sv`` under the issue-and-wait execution model: every dispatch
op is *atomic* — read its operands out of the scratchpad, compute, write the
result back — so no cycle-level modelling is needed to reproduce the final
memory state a real run leaves behind.

It exists to produce the golden result vectors that
``accel/tpu/tb/tpu_top_tb.sv`` checks the DUT against: load the same program and
input tensors, run this simulator, and the final scratchpad image is what the
hardware must reproduce byte-for-byte.

Numerics are kept bit-exact with the RTL:
  * MXU matmul: int4 activations (in int8 containers) x **row-major int4**
    weights, int32 accumulate, optional ``clip((acc*m0 + round) >> n)``
    requantize on store (mxu.sv requant8, clipping to [-8, 7]).
  * VPU ops: int8 operands, int32 accumulate, int32 writeback; VOP_REQUANT
    narrows int32->int4 with the same fixed-point rescale (vpu.sv requant8),
    and VOP_DYT does the same with a symmetric +-7 clip (vpu.sv dyt8) — that
    clip is DyT's hardtanh, not an approximation of it. VOP_QUANT4 is the same
    rescale written as a 4-bit two's-complement nibble, two elements per byte
    (vpu.sv quant4), which is how an activation becomes a weight operand
    without a round trip through the host.

DMA (rdmem/wrmem) is modelled as a real byte copy between a separate external
**DRAM** space and the on-chip scratchpad, over ``cfg 'len'`` bytes — matching the
``dma.sv``/``sram.sv`` engine. The two memories are **different sizes**: the
scratchpad is ``2**addr_w`` (16 bits) and DRAM is ``2**mem_addr_w`` (19 bits, the
Cmod A7's 512K x 8 SRAM), so each side of a transfer is masked in its own space
(``_a`` vs ``_d``). Sizing DRAM off ``addr_w`` — as this did until
``scalar_unit.sv`` stopped truncating its DRAM address — silently aliases
anything above 64 KB back into the low window.

The engine is the one wired into ``tpu_top.sv`` (and is how ``tpu_top_tb.sv``
seeds/reads DRAM). This lets a kernel stream tiles: fill a small
fixed scratchpad buffer from an advancing DRAM address, compute, spill the result
back to a distinct DRAM address — so the operands need not all fit in scratchpad.
Inputs live in DRAM, ``rdmem`` fills scratchpad, and ``wrmem`` is what makes a byte
host-visible again, so the golden outputs are exactly the DRAM bytes ``wrmem`` wrote
(tracked in ``dram_written``). ``rdmem.t``/``wrmem.t`` move the same bytes with a
transposed destination order (docs/dma.md §5). Inter-TPU LINK (wrneigh) is still a
no-op — no link engine is attached.
