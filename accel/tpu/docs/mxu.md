# MXU — Matrix Unit

Weight-stationary systolic array that computes the ternary-weight matmuls of the model.
See [README](README.md) §2 for the high-level role and [scratchpad.md](scratchpad.md)
for the memory it reads/writes.

## 1. Scope

The MXU handles every **ternary-weight × int8-activation** matmul in the transformer —
which, since ternary K/V and a ternary output head, means *every matmul in the model*:

| Op             | Shape (per token tile) | Notes                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo | `T×128 @ 128×128`      | attention projections                 |
| Q @ Kᵀ         | `T×32 @ 32×T`          | per head; K is a ternary *activation*  |
| P @ V          | `T×T @ T×32`           | per head; V likewise                  |
| FF fc1         | `T×128 @ 128×512`      | tiled over output columns             |
| FF fc2         | `T×512 @ 512×128`      | tiled over the contraction            |
| output head    | `T×128 @ 128×16`       | `Model.fc` is ternary; 16 = 13 padded |

The last row is why the head is padded: this array stores a whole `COLS`-wide output
tile, so a 13-column result would have its second tile overrun each row into the next
one's first three words. `adder_model.tpu` rounds the head up to 16 columns and the
host stages the top three as zero trits (`adder_kernel.md` §2.6).

The attention rows are recent too. `Q@K^T` and `P@V` are
activation × activation, which this array cannot do — so they ran on the [VPU](vpu.md) as
`vecmatmul`, one serial dot product per output element, and were the slowest thing in the
shipped kernel (36.4% of the whole run, `macro_ops.md` §7). The fix was to pack the
operand that lands on the *weight* side into this array's weight layout: K in `Q@K^T`, V in `P@V`, both written by `quant4` straight
into the packed 4-bit layout. See `accel/tpulang/adder_kernel.md` §2.5.

There is no softmax to compute anywhere: attention is ReLU, so the only thing between the
two matmuls is a `vecadd` against an int8 mask and a `relu`, both on the VPU.

## 2. The PE is a multiplier again

**This section used to say the opposite, and the change is the main cost of int4.** With
ternary weights `w ∈ {−1, 0, +1}` the multiply degenerated into a select + conditional
negate — `w=+1 → acc += a`, `w=0 → pass through`, `w=−1 → acc -= a` — so a PE was an
add/sub plus a 2-bit weight register, no DSP and no multiplier. That was the whole reason
the model was quantized to ternary.

int4 weights have 16 levels, so `rtl/mxu.sv::weight_product` is a real signed multiply:

```
acc = psum_in + a * w        a : int8 container (int4 values), w : int4
```

What softens it: the activation narrowed at the same time. The product bound went from
`127 × 1` to `8 × 8`, so the **accumulator got cheaper, not dearer** — `PSUM_W = 16` now
carries `ROWS*64 = 8192` at `ROWS=128` against the ternary array's `ROWS*127 = 16256`.
The cost is confined to the multiplier array: 64 signed 4×8 multiplies at the synthesized
`8×8` geometry, LUT-mapped (the -35T has 90 DSPs and the VPU already holds 32).

The int4 range is enforced, not assumed: every `requant`/`dyt`/`quant4` clips to
`[-8, 7]` / `[-7, 7]`, so no chain of matmuls can present an operand that overflows the
bound above. Feeding genuine int8 activations would need `ROWS ≤ 32`.

## 3. Array geometry

Parameterized `ROWS × COLS` array; suggested default **`128 × 128`** so the adder
model's `d=128` contraction and 128-wide projections map to a single tile with no
inner tiling. On a smaller board, drop to `64×64` or `32×32` and tile (§6).

- **Rows** = contraction dimension (`d`). Each row streams one activation element per
  clock into the array.
- **Cols** = output features. Each column holds one stationary weight column and
  accumulates one output element per token.
- Dataflow: activations flow **left→right**, partial sums flow **top→bottom**
  (classic weight-stationary OS/WS hybrid — weights stationary, activations stream,
  each column produces a full dot product).

### PE

```
          a_in (int8) ─────────────┐
                                    ▼
weight reg (int4) ──► [  ×  ] ──►(+)──► acc (int32) ──► psum_out (down)
                                    ▲
          psum_in (int32, from PE above)
                        a_out (int8) ──► next PE (right)
```

Each PE registers `a_in` for one cycle before passing it right, creating the systolic
skew. `acc = psum_in + a_in * w`.

## 4. Operation phases

A `Matmul(act_addr, weight_addr, out_addr)` runs in three overlapping phases:

1. **Weight load.** Stream the `ROWS × COLS` int4 tile from scratchpad into the PE
   weight registers, 4-bit packed. Weights are stored **row-major**, so one `W_rd` is one
   array *row* (`COLS` nibbles) and the loop runs `ROWS` times — for a square array
   exactly the width and cycle count the column-major ternary load took, with the fill
   order transposed. Overlaps the drain of the previous tile so back-to-back matmuls hide
   load latency.
2. **Feed.** Read one activation column (`d` int8 = 1024 bits) per clock from the
   activation banks and inject it **staggered** across rows — row *i* is delayed *i*
   cycles so all contributions to a given output element line up. This is why the
   scratchpad must deliver a full column per clock.
3. **Drain.** Column sums fall out the bottom after `ROWS + COLS + T` cycles and are
   written to `out_addr` as int32, one result row per token.

Latency for one `T×d @ d×COLS` tile ≈ `ROWS + COLS + T` cycles; throughput is one
output column per clock once the pipeline is full.

## 5. Numerics

- Accumulate in **int32**. Worst case per output element is `d` terms of
  `±127`; `128 × 127 ≈ 16 k`, well inside int32 — no saturation needed mid-accumulate.
- **Requantize on store.** BitNet-style: the reference folds a per-tensor
  `scale = mean(|W|)` into the ternary weights, so the int32 accumulator is multiplied
  by `scale` (and any activation scale) then rounded/clipped back to int8 on the way to
  scratchpad. The rescale is a fixed-point `clip((acc*M0 + round) >> N)` (same math as
  `requant.sv` / the VPU's `VOP_REQUANT`); the per-tensor `{M0, N}` word is read once
  from `scalar_addr`. It is applied by the store-path requantizer, **not** inside the PEs.
  Requant is gated by the `requant` input: assert it to narrow the store to int8; leave
  it clear to write int32 — the mode intermediate contraction tiles use so `accumulate`
  can keep running int32 partials in the result bank (§6), with only the final tile
  asserting `requant`.
- Bias add (projections have bias) is folded into the requantizer as an int32 add before
  rounding.

Validate bit-exactly against `TernaryLinear` in `model/transformer.py`: quantize `W`
with `RoundClip(W/scale)`, run `x @ w_quant`, compare.

## 6. Tiling (arrays smaller than the matmul)

For `COLS_array < N_out` (e.g. fc1's 512 outputs on a 128-wide array): iterate output
tiles, reloading weights each tile, accumulating each tile's results independently.
For `ROWS_array < d` (e.g. fc2's 512 contraction on a 128-tall array): split the
contraction, keep a **running int32 partial** in the result bank, and add successive
row-tiles into it before requantizing. The scalar unit emits the tile loop; each tile is
one hardware `Matmul`.

## 7. Interface

| Signal        | Dir | Width     | Meaning                              |
| ------------- | --- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `start`       | in  | 1         | begin matmul (from scalar unit)      |
| `act_addr`    | in  | addr      | activation tile base                 |
| `weight_addr` | in  | addr      | ternary weight tile base             |
| `out_addr`    | in  | addr      | result base (int32, or int8 if requant) |
| `scalar_addr` | in  | addr      | requant `{M0, N}` word (used if requant) |
| `t_len`       | in  | 6         | number of token columns (`T`)        |
| `accumulate`  | in  | 1         | add into existing int32 result (tiling) |
| `requant`     | in  | 1         | narrow store int32→int8 via `{M0, N}` |
| `busy`        | out | 1         | high during load/feed/drain          |
| `done`        | out | 1         | pulse when result fully written      |

The store uses a per-byte `C_wstrb`, so an int8 requant row (COLS bytes) writes only its
lanes and does not clobber the neighbouring int32-width result bytes.

## 8. Open questions

- Final `ROWS × COLS` — depends on LUT/FF budget of the target board.
- Skew buffering: dedicated shift registers vs. reusing the activation bank read
  address staggering.
- Whether to fuse the `Wo` output residual-add (`O + X`) into the requantizer or leave
  it to the VPU.
