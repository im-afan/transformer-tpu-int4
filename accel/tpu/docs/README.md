## Component docs

Detailed per-component design notes (this file is the overview):

| Doc                              | Component                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [scratchpad.md](scratchpad.md)   | On-chip BRAM working memory, banking, sizing          |
| [mxu.md](mxu.md)                 | Weight-stationary ternary systolic matrix unit        |

| [macro_ops.md](macro_ops.md)     | Moving tiling/attention into hardware (CISC macro-ops). Phases 0–3 **are built** (`setcfgr`, MXU strides, `matmul_t`); `vecmatmul` and `softmax` were built then removed, `layernorm` is dropped — see its banner |
| [picorv32_migration.md](picorv32_migration.md) | The macro-op **dispatch plane**: 128-bit commands in per-unit queues instead of a global config file, and PicoRV32 as a second producer beside the scalar unit.

The assembly language that lowers 1:1 onto the ISA is documented in
[`accel/tpulang/README.md`](../../tpulang/README.md), and the host driver that speaks the
protocol in [`accel/tpu/host/README.md`](../host/README.md).

> **This file is the original design sketch**, kept because §1 is still an accurate
> statement of intent. Where it disagrees with a component doc above, the component doc

> [isa.md](isa.md) for what the machine actually implements).

## 1. Overview

This is a design for a TPU that goes on low-end FPGA boards for inferencing transformers.
To minimize area usage, we target highly quantized neural networks: those with weights in ${1, 0, -1}$ 
and 8-bit activations. We target running a ternary version of the digit-predicting adder LLM. We also design for scale-out,
allowing multiple devices to communicate during inference.

We use the same general architecture as google TPU:

### 1. Scratchpad

We will use DMA to access RAM and load into a specific address in our scratchpad memory, which uses FPGA BRAM. 

### 2. MXU

The MXU is a weight-stationary systolic array. It will load the ternary weights from scratchpad memory into registers in each PE.
Then, it loads activations from the scratchpad into the activation buffer and feeds them into the systolic array in a staggered order. 
The scratchpad should consist of enough BRAM blocks to fully load 1 column of activations in 1 clock.
The MXU output immediately gets written to another address in scratchpad memory.

### 3. VPU

The VPU performs the remaining pointwise vector operations using SIMD: `relu`, vector add, and the `requant`/`dyt`/`quant4` narrows. `quant4` is the one whose destination is narrower than a byte: it writes a bare 4-bit nibble, two per byte, in the MXU's packed weight layout — which is what lets an *activation* be a weight operand, and therefore what moved both attention matmuls onto the array. The output head went with them once `Model.fc` became an `Int4Linear`, which left the `vecmatmul` macro op with no caller and is why it has been **removed** — along with its geometry registers and the `VPU_GEOM` command. The unit is deliberately no larger than this: the activation LUTs, broadcast/scalar ops, divider, reductions and the softmax macro op went the same way once the model stopped needing them ([vpu.md §Removed ops](vpu.md#removed-ops)). `vecdot` survives with no caller because it *is* the reduction datapath. 
It contains multiple ALUs that act on data from a single scratchpad memory access.

### 4. Communication interface

Furthermore, we implement an inter-TPU interface that allows a TPU to receive requests to write to the RAM of its neighbors. For now, we implement a 2d connection scheme (4 neighbors).

*Status: designed in [comms.md](comms.md), but not built. `tpu_top.sv` ties the `nb_*` port
off, so the `wrneigh` instruction completes as a no-op in both the RTL and the ISS.*

### 5. Scalar Unit

Handles all the control, dispatches instructions to the VPU and MXU. Reads from instruction memory.
Also handles scalar operations such as adding, multiplying numbers in memory.

The instruction set that grew out of this sketch is specified in [isa.md](isa.md) and
summarized, with assembler syntax, in
[`accel/tpulang/README.md`](../../tpulang/README.md#14-instruction-set). Two things about the
real ISA differ from the shape implied above and are worth stating here, because they change
how programs are written:

- **Operands are registers, not immediates.** An instruction names registers; the register
  *contents* are the byte addresses the unit operates on. So `matmul rout, ract, rweight`,
  after an `li` puts each address in a register.
- **Sizes are not in the instruction.** They come from config registers set beforehand —
  `setcfg tlen` (MXU token count), `setcfg vlen` (VPU vector length), `setcfg len` (DMA byte
  count). Stale config is the most common silent bug in a tpulang program.

The dispatched ops are `matmul` / `matmul_t` (with `.acc`/`.rq` flags),
`vecdot`, `vecadd`, `relu`, `requant`, `dyt`, and `quant4`; memory movement is `rdmem` / `wrmem` (DMA between DRAM and scratchpad) and
`wrneigh`; control is `adds`, `subs`, `muls`, `cmps`, `li`, `loads`, `stores`, `setcfg`,
`branch` (and the `beq`/`bne`/`blt`/`bge` forms), `jmp`, `wait`, and `halt`.
