# Macro-op ISA (CISC) — design note

**Status: phases 0–4 built and validated; 5 built then removed; 6 dropped; 7 not started.**
See §8 for the phase table.

Built and passing (`tb/` 13/13, `make cosim` 11/11, `torch_ref.py` all kernels):

| Piece | Where | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-run performance counters | `rtl/perf_counters.sv` (replaces `cycle_timer.sv`) | `fw_uart_tb` structural + per-kernel checks, decoded from the `'T'` reply (`make fwuart`) |
| `setcfgr` (register → config) | `scalar_unit.sv` `0x1C` | `examples/setcfgr.tpu` |
| MXU config strides | `mxu.sv` `a_row`/`c_row`/`w_row` | `examples/strided_matmul.tpu` |
| `matmul_t` hardware tile loop | `mxu.sv` `0x1D` | `examples/tiled_matmul_hw.tpu` |
| ~~`vecmatmul`~~ | *removed* — was `vpu.sv` `VOP_VECMATMUL`, opcode `0x1E` | *(was `examples/vecmatmul.tpu`; deleted)* |
| ~~`softmax`~~ | *removed* — was `vpu.sv` `VOP_SOFTMAX`/`VOP_SM_EXP`, opcode `0x20` | *(was `vpu_tb` + `examples/softmax_rows.tpu`; both deleted)* |

Measured instruction counts, same problem in each case:

| Kernel | Software | Macro-op |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8×32 @ 32×16 tiled matmul | 70 words | **25** words — and that does it *twice* (int32 and requantized) |
| ~~Attention score block~~ | *44 words (`vpu_matmul.tpu`)* | *17 words (`vecmatmul.tpu`)* — measured before the op was removed; attention is now `matmul_t` on the array |
| ~~Softmax over a row block~~ | *8 words per row + a scalar bridge* | *18 words for 5 rows* — measured before the op was removed; kept as the record of what a fused macro op bought |

Not built: the full-layer rewrite (§8 phase 7) and weight double-buffering (§4.5).
`layernorm` + the `rsqrt` LUT (§5.2) are **dropped**, not pending — see the banner.

## 1. Why

The ISA today is RISC-shaped: one instruction is one array pass or one vector pass, and
everything above that — tile loops, and at the time softmax and LayerNorm — is expanded in
the program. That choice has three measured costs:

| Symptom | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Instruction memory is the binding constraint | One quantized layer = **861 of 1024** words (`README.md` roadmap §7); `tiled_matmul.tpu` alone is 191 lines |
| Programs are not hand-writable at layer scale | the since-deleted `softmax_row.tpu` was 72 lines for **one row**; `vpu_matmul.tpu` is 129 lines for one score block |
| The datatype contract is hand-enforced and silently breakable | `softmax_row.tpu:64-65` — `sadd` wrote int32 (4-byte stride), `exp` read int8 (1-byte stride), with nothing checking it. Still true of any int8/int32 pairing; that example is gone |

The fix is not a different control processor (see the PicoRV32 discussion — it costs LUTs
we don't have at 92% utilization and replaces the working, bit-exact `iss.py` chain). The
fix is to **raise the work-per-instruction**, which is what TPU v1 did: ~12 instructions,
CISC, >10 cycles each on average, with `MatrixMultiply` taking a variable-size operand and
sequencing the tiling in hardware.

Goal: a transformer layer that is **40–60 instructions and hand-writable**, with
`assembler.py` staying a table lookup rather than growing into a compiler.

## 2. Scope — what changes and what does not

**Unchanged.** The scalar unit stays (issue-and-wait, same FSM, same 32-bit encoding). The
PE array, the VPU lane datapath, the scratchpad, DMA, the UART link, and every numeric
convention in `isa.md` §A.5 (ternary packing, requant, Q15 `sdiv`) are untouched. The
existing primitive opcodes all stay valid.

**Changed.** Three things gain internal sequencers:

- **MXU** — an outer tile loop over the contraction (`k`) and output (`n`) axes, with
  configurable row strides. New opcode; the existing single-tile `matmul` is retained.
- **VPU** — three macro ops (`softmax`, `layernorm`, `vecmatmul`) implemented as a wrapper
  FSM that issues the existing `VOP_*` passes internally. *(None survive — see the
  banner. The VPU has no macro op today.)*
- **Config file** — five new registers for the matmul geometry, two for the VPU.

**Explicitly out of scope.** Removing branches (`beq`/`jmp` still drive the layer loop),
the inter-TPU LINK, and any change to the host protocol.

## 3. Opcode and config budget

Both have room; check this before adding anything else.

- **Opcode field is 6 bits = 64 slots.** Used: `0x00–0x1B` and `0x1F`. Free: `0x1C–0x1E`
  and the whole of `0x20–0x3E`. No pressure.
- **`flags` is only 2 bits and `matmul` already uses both** (`acc`, `rq`). A "tiled" bit
  does not fit — hence a new opcode rather than a flag.
- **`cfg` was `CFG_AW=4` = 16 registers**, of which `0..3` are assigned (`tlen`, `vlen`,
  `len`, `scalar`). Twelve free; this proposal takes eleven (ten below, plus `vcrow`).
  *Since built:* the DMA's transpose geometry (`dma.md` §5) needed three more, so `CFG_AW`
  is now **5** — 32 registers, `0..17` assigned. Widening cost only the register file; the
  `dst` field was already 8 bits.
- **`setcfg` is immediate-only** (`CFG` form: `cfg[dst] = zero_extend(imm16)`). There is no
  register→config path, so no config value can vary at runtime. §9.2 needs one; see
  `setcfgr` below.
- **`vpu_op` is 4 bits and codes `0..12` are used** — only 3 free, which the three macro
  ops exactly consume. **Widen `vpu_op` to 5 bits now** (a port-width change in `vpu.sv`,
  `scalar_unit.sv`, `tpu_top.sv` — three lines) rather than landing at exactly full.

### New config registers

| Idx | Name | Width | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | `ktiles` | 8 | contraction tiles = `K / ROWS` |
| 5 | `ntiles` | 8 | output tiles = `N / COLS` |
| 6 | `arow` | 16 | activation row stride in bytes (`= K`) |
| 7 | `crow` | 16 | result row stride in bytes (`= N*4`, or `N` when requantizing) |
| 8 | `wrow` | 16 | weight **row** stride in bytes (`= N*4/8`) |
| 9 | ~~`vscalar`~~ | — | **retired** with `softmax`, the only op that read it. Index left vacant so 10–17 keep their meaning |
| 10–14 | ~~`vrows`, `vcols`, `vrow0`, `vrow1`, `vcrow`~~ | — | **retired** with `vecmatmul`, their only reader: query rows, key rows, the two source row strides and the int32 dst row stride. Indices left vacant so 15–17 keep their meaning |

15..17 went to the DMA transpose geometry (`dma.md` §5); 18..31 are free. `vscalar` was
deliberately *not* `cfg3 scalar` — that one is the MXU's requant word, and the two were
live simultaneously inside a layer.

`vrows` and `vcols` were separate because `vecmatmul` was **not square** in general:
decode attends one query row against `t+1` key rows (§9.2). The same asymmetry is now the
MXU's, and `matmul_t` already takes an `M` per dispatch.

### New scalar opcode: `setcfgr`

```
setcfgr  name, rN      cfg[name] = rN        ; opcode 0x1C, new CFGR form
```

The only genuinely new instruction outside the macro ops, and the only new assembler
*form* (`dst` = cfg index, `src0` = register). The config file already has a write port
from `setcfg`; this muxes its data source from the register file instead of the sign-
extended immediate — on the order of 20 LUTs.

Without it, nothing computed at runtime can reach a config register, which makes every
macro op's geometry a compile-time constant. That is fine for prefill and fatal for
decode.

## 4. MXU: hardware-tiled matmul

### 4.0 Why tiling is a separate opcode, not a flag

`matmul`'s `flags` field is 2 bits and `.acc`/`.rq` use both, so a "tiled" bit does not
fit. But there is a stronger reason than encoding pressure, found while building this:

**Config registers are not cleared between runs.** An earlier plan had the MXU key tiling
off "the stride registers are nonzero", with zero meaning the single-tile default. That
works for one program and breaks for two — running `strided_matmul.tpu` (which sets
`arow=16`, `crow=64`, `wcol=4`) and then `relu_layer.tpu` made the second program's plain
`matmul` read its operands at the first program's strides, corrupting every output byte.
The two-program `tpu_top_uart_tb` sequence caught this. That testbench went with the
scalar unit; `make fwuart FWPROG=<kernel> RERUN=1` (`tb/fw_uart_tb.sv`) is the
two-runs-one-link case now, and it found a restart bug of its own the moment it existed
— [`picorv32_migration.md`](picorv32_migration.md) §9.11. A single-program test never
would have seen either.

So `matmul_t` (opcode `0x1D`) reads the strides and `matmul` (`0x00`) ignores them
outright. The mode is a property of the instruction, not of leftover machine state. Within
`matmul_t` an unset (zero) stride still falls back to the single-tile value, so a missing
`setcfg` degrades to something sane rather than addressing everything at offset zero.

A related latent bug surfaced at the same time: the `cfg` array had **no reset**, so an
unread config register was X in simulation and undefined on hardware. Harmless while every
program set each register it used; not harmless once the MXU began reading `a_row`/`c_row`/
`w_col` on every dispatch. `scalar_unit.sv` now resets the whole config file.

### 4.1 The problem with the current address generation

Three strides are hardcoded and all three assume the operand *is* one tile:

| `mxu.sv` | Current | Needs to be |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A_raddr = act_a + arq*ROWS` (L240) | row stride `ROWS` | `cfg arow` (`= K`) |
| `RES_STRIDE = COLS*4` (L125) | row stride `COLS*4` | `cfg crow` (`= N*4`) |
| `W_raddr = wgt_a + wreq*WCOL_BYTES` (L236) | column stride `ROWS*2/8` | `cfg wcol` (`= K*2/8`) |

`WCOL_BYTES` remains correct as the *intra-column k-tile offset* — a k-tile advances
`ROWS*2/8` bytes down within a column. So the weight address for tile `(k,n)`, column `c`
is:

```
W_raddr = wgt_a + (n*COLS + c) * cfg.wcol + k * WCOL_BYTES
```

### 4.2 Loop order — and the win that falls out of it

Order the tiles **`n` outer, `k` inner**:

```
for n in 0 .. ntiles-1:
    clear resbuf
    for k in 0 .. ktiles-1:
        LOAD  weight tile (k,n)
        RUN   stream A[:, k*ROWS : (k+1)*ROWS], accumulate into resbuf
    WB    write resbuf once, requantized if cfg.rq
```

Because `resbuf` already holds `MAXT × COLS` int32 partials, **the partial sums never leave
the chip across the `k` loop.** That deletes the `.acc` readback path for intermediate
tiles entirely, which is worth more than the instruction-count saving:

- No int32 `C` staging buffer in the scratchpad — at `COLS=8`, a `T×K` contraction
  currently needs `T*COLS*4` bytes of int32 partials round-tripping per tile.
- The `C_rw` port is idle during the whole `k` loop, so it stops contending on the
  scratchpad's arbitrated read port.
- The three-way `matmul` / `matmul.acc` / `matmul.acc.rq` choreography that the programmer
  hand-manages today (`isa.md` §6) becomes internal and unmissable.

Keep the `accumulate` flag for its *other* use — adding into a pre-existing `C` buffer
(cross-`M` accumulation, or a second call into the same output).

### 4.3 The `MAXT` limit — decide this explicitly

`TOK_W = 6`, so `MAXT = 64` and `t_len` is 6 bits: **at most 63 token rows per dispatch.**
For the adder model that is fine (`EQUALS_POS = 15`, sequences ~20–24 tokens), so the
initial implementation can leave `M` untiled and simply document the ceiling.

If you want generality, the `M` loop is a third counter and costs nothing extra in the
datapath — but it does *not* need `resbuf` to grow, since each `M`-tile drains before the
next begins. Recommend: implement `M` tiling in the ISS from the start (free), leave it out
of RTL v1, and make the assembler reject `tlen > 63`.

### 4.4 Cost estimate

Three counters (`k`, `n`, and the existing token counter), three stride multipliers folded
into the address adders, and a `resbuf`-clear state. No change to the PE array, the skew
buffers, or `requant8`. Rough guess **200–400 LUTs**; `mxu` is already 10,845 of the
design's 19,227, and you are at 92%. **Get a real number with
`mode=ooc module=mxu` before and after** — the `synth.md` §5 estimates were wrong by 3×
on `scratchpad`, in the good direction, but do not assume that twice.

### 4.5 Optional phase 2: weight double-buffering

With hardware tiling, the `k` loop alternates LOAD (COLS cycles) and RUN (~`T + ROWS`
cycles) with no overlap. Double-buffering the PE weight registers lets tile `k+1` load
while tile `k` streams — this is TPU v1's weight FIFO, and it is the single largest
throughput lever the tiled matmul unlocks. Cost is `ROWS*COLS*2` bits of extra weight
register: **128 FFs at the board's 8×8 geometry**, which is nothing. FFs are at 48%.

Do this *after* the tiled matmul is correct, and measure it — it is a clean before/after
roofline result.

## 5. VPU macro ops

> **None of these exist any more.** All three were wrapper FSMs issuing the existing
> `VOP_*` passes internally; `softmax` was built and removed, `layernorm` was never
> built, and `vecmatmul` was built, measured (§7) and then removed once int4 K/V put

All were a **wrapper FSM** that issued the existing `VOP_*` passes internally and held the
scalar intermediates in registers. The lane datapath and `V_rw` were unchanged. Reduction
results stayed in internal registers instead of round-tripping through the scratchpad,
which is what killed the `loads`/`subs`/`stores` bridge idiom (`isa.md` §4.5) from
programs.

### 5.1 `softmax dst, src, tmp` — REMOVED

> Built, validated, and then removed along with the VPU ops it was made of. The model uses
> ReLU attention. Retained below as the design record; **this is not the current ISA.**

Four passes over a row of `cfg vlen` elements, repeated `cfg vrows` times:

| Pass | Reads | Computes | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `src` int8 | `m = max_i x[i]` | internal register |
| 2 | `src` int8 | `exp_lut[requant(x[i] - m, cfg.vscalar)]` | `tmp` **int8** |
| 3 | `tmp` int8 | `D = Σ e[i]` | internal register |
| 4 | `tmp` int8 | `round(e[i] * 2^15 / D)` (Q15) | `dst` int32 |

Pass 2 is the important one: it **fuses `sadd` + `requant` + `exp` into one pass that
writes narrow.** That is what makes pass 3's int8 read correct by construction, and it is
precisely the mismatch `softmax_row.tpu:64-65` got wrong. The `{m0,n}` word lands
the operand in the exp LUT's canonical 1/16 input scale (`vpu.sv` header, §Activation
LUTs) — an obligation currently on the programmer, with nothing checking it.

`tmp` is an explicit third operand because the int8→int32 width expansion in pass 4 would
otherwise clobber unread data. *Optimization worth noting, not doing first:* walking pass 4
**backwards** makes it safe in place (the int32 write at byte `4i` is above every unread
int8 at `j < i`), removing the `tmp` operand at the cost of a reverse-order streaming mode.

### 5.2 `layernorm dst, src, tmp` — DROPPED

> Never built, and no longer planned. `model/transformer.py` replaced LayerNorm with DyT
> (`hardtanh(alpha*x, -1, 1)`), which needs no macro op, no `rsqrt`, no square and no
> divide: it is `requant` with a symmetric clip (`dyt`, `0x21`), fused into the narrow the
> residual add already performed. The proposal below is kept for the reasoning about
> `rsqrt` and about keeping γ/β out of an instruction, which would apply again if a
> variance-based norm ever came back.

The model *used to use* `nn.LayerNorm`, which needs
`1/sqrt(var)` — and **the VPU has no square root.** `sdiv` gives `1/d`, not `1/sqrt(d)`.

Recommendation: **add an `rsqrt` LUT** as a third 256-entry int8 ROM, generated by
a `tpulang/luts.py` exactly like the since-deleted `gelu`/`exp` tables, loaded via a new `RSQRT_INIT` parameter. Same
pattern, same canonical-input-scale caveat, negligible area (`gelu_rom` and `exp_rom` are
already there and `vpu` uses 0 BRAM — they infer as LUTROM).

Passes: `Σx` → mean (multiply by the compile-time `1/L` as a `{m0,n}`), then `x - mean`
into `tmp`, then `Σ(x-mean)²` → var, then `rsqrt_lut[var]`, then scale.

**Keep γ and β out of the macro-op.** They are per-channel *vectors*, and folding them in
pushes the operand count past what the encoding holds. Emit them as a following
`vecemul` + `vecadd` pair — two extra instructions per norm, four per layer. Not worth
distorting the instruction format for.

### 5.3 `vecmatmul dst, src0, src1` — REMOVED

> **Built, validated, measured, and then removed.** `vecmatmul` existed because the MXU
> multiplies a *weight* by an *activation* and attention's `Q@K^T` and `P@V` are
> activation × activation, so they could not touch the array at all. `QUANT4` ended that:

> record; **this is not the current ISA.**

The MXU is **ternary-weight × int8-activation** (`mxu.sv` header). Attention's `Q@K^T` and
`P@V` were activation × activation, so they could not touch the MXU at all — which is why
`vpu_matmul.tpu` exists and is 129 lines. This was the single biggest instruction-count
item in a layer and the CISC matmul of §4 does nothing for it.

`vecmatmul` wraps the existing `VOP_DOT` datapath in a two-level counter:

```
S[t][s] = Σ_d src0[t][d] * src1[s][d]      for t in cfg.vrows, s in cfg.vcols
```

contracting over `cfg vlen`, with `src0`/`src1` row strides from `cfg vrow0`/`cfg vrow1`
(these are **not** equal to `vlen` when a head is a slice of a wider `[T][heads*head_dim]`
tensor). K is read row-major, so **`K^T` is never materialized** — the transpose is
implicit in the loop order, exactly as `vpu_matmul.tpu` already documents. Output is int32
at `cfg crow` stride.

That implicit transpose covers `Q@K^T` and **not** `P@V`, which contracts over keys — V's
*row* axis — and so needs a real `V^T` whichever way round you write it. That is the DMA's
job rather than this op's: `wrmem.t`/`rdmem.t` ([dma.md](dma.md) §5) do it in one dispatch.

`vrows` and `vcols` are independent so decode (`vrows=1`, `vcols=t+1`) and prefill
(`vrows=vcols=T`) are the same instruction. Both come from `setcfgr` when they vary.

This is `vrows² ` dot products of length `vlen`, at `LANES = 8` on the board geometry
(`vpu_bytes=32`). It is slow — but it is *already* slow, one instruction at a time, and
collapsing it removes ~120 instruction words.

## 6. Toolchain changes

### `assembler.py`

Purely additive — new `SPECS` entries and new `CFG_NAMES`. No new *form* is needed:
`matmul_t` is `RRR` (dst/act/weight, geometry from cfg), and all three VPU macro ops are
`RRR`. This is the point: the assembler stays a table.

Add one validation that does not exist today: **reject `tlen > 63`** (`TOK_W` limit, §4.3).

### `iss.py`

The tiled matmul makes the ISS **simpler, not harder.** `_matmul` currently models one
tile; the macro version is one atomic operation over the full `M×K×N` shape. Bit-exactness
is preserved regardless of tile order because int32 accumulation is associative (including
under two's-complement wraparound), so the ISS does **not** need to replicate the hardware's
`n`-outer/`k`-inner order to match.

The VPU macro ops must model the pass structure exactly — specifically pass 2's fused
requant-then-LUT and its **int8** intermediate — because that *is* the numerics. Do not
model `softmax` as float and round at the end.

### `pytpu.py`

Its whole reason for existing (docstring: "instruction memory is 1024 words, so anything
shaped like a tensor loop has to stay a loop") is substantially relieved. It stays useful
for the layer/geometry loop, but the tile loops it exists to emit move into hardware.

## 7. Observability — this becomes mandatory

Hardware tiling **hides the tile loop from the program**, so you can no longer infer
weight-load vs. stream vs. drain from an instruction trace. Today `cycle_timer` counts one
number: total `busy` cycles for a run. That was already too coarse for a roofline; after
this change it is the *only* thing you'd have.

Add alongside `cycle_timer`, surfaced on the UART `'T'` command:

| Counter | Source | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mxu_busy_cycles` | `mxu.busy` | MXU utilization |
| `mxu_load_cycles` | `mxu.state == S_LOAD` | weight-load overhead — and the phase-2 double-buffer payoff |
| `vpu_busy_cycles` | `vpu.busy` | how much of the layer is attention rather than GEMM |
| `dma_busy_cycles` | `dma.busy` | memory-bound vs. compute-bound — the roofline's x-axis |
| `su_wait_cycles` | `scalar_unit.state == S_WAIT` | control overhead, i.e. what issue-and-wait actually costs |
| ~~`vpu_mm_cycles`~~ | *was `vpu.vpu_mm_busy`* | of the VPU's share, how much is `vecmatmul` — **retired with the op**; counter 6 (`vmm`) is tied low and kept only so the `'T'` reply does not renumber |

Six 32-bit counters and their UART readback: ~200 FFs, ~150 LUTs. This is the cheapest
work in this document and the only item that directly produces the analysis the project
exists for. **Build it first** — it also gives you honest before/after numbers for
everything else here.

**On the last row.** It was added after the fact, for a concrete reason. On the full
adder model the VPU counter reads **41.2% of the run** — implausibly high for a unit whose
surviving ops are pointwise over vectors of at most 128 elements, and `vpu_busy` alone
cannot say which op it is. `vecmatmul` was the suspect because it is the only VPU op whose
cost is quadratic in sequence length: it re-enters the inner dot product once per
(row, col) pair, and each entry pays the whole `S_RD0`/`S_RD0D`/`S_RD1`/`S_RD1D`/`S_EXEC`/
`S_WB` round trip around a contraction only `head_dim = 32` long. Counter 6
(`vmm`, `vpu_mm_busy = vpu_busy && mm_active`) settles that by measurement rather than by
argument, and being a strict subset of counter 3 it subtracts to give the pointwise share
for free.

| counter | % of run |
| --- | --- |
| mxu | 34.0 |
|  of which mload | 5.7 |
| vpu | 41.2 |
|  of which **vmm** | **36.4** |
| dma | 24.2 |
| swait | 99.5 |

So **`vecmatmul` is 88.3% of all VPU time** and the other five ops together are 4.8% of the
run. The VPU's share is not the pointwise datapath at all — it is the macro op's per-pair
sequencing overhead, and it is now the single largest non-`swait` counter after the MXU.
Any attempt to bring the VPU's 41% down has to attack `vecmatmul`'s inner loop (the six
states per pair, over a 32-element contraction that occupies only two of the sixteen lanes'
worth of chunks); tuning the pointwise path can recover at most 4.8%.

**That is what happened, and it is why the op no longer exists.** The inner loop was not
tuned — it was made unnecessary: packing K and V to int4 (`QUANT4`) put both attention
matmuls on the array, which deleted the 36.4% rather than shrinking it. `vecmatmul` was
then dead code and was removed. This counter is the reason the change was made to the
right thing, and it is also the reason the counter itself is no longer needed: the VPU
now runs only pointwise ops, so `vpu` is no longer ambiguous.

## 8. Migration plan

Each phase leaves the tree green.

| Phase | Work | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Cycle counters (§7) + `'T'` command extension | **done** — seven counters, `'T'` returns a 7-word block, word 0 still the run length |
| 1 | `vpu_op` widened to 5 bits; new cfg registers + `setcfgr` (§3) wired through `scalar_unit`/`tpu_top`; assembler + ISS know the names | **done** — no behavior change; whole suite still green |
| 2 | MXU strides from cfg (§4.1), still single-tile | **done** — `tiled_matmul.tpu` passes unmodified; `strided_matmul.tpu` proves the strides are consulted |
| 3 | MXU tile loop + `matmul_t` opcode (§4.2) | **done** — `tiled_matmul_hw.tpu`, checked against an independent Python matmul over the full K |
| 4 | `vecmatmul` | built and validated (`vecmatmul.tpu`, deliberately non-square 12×20), then **removed** — int4 K/V put attention on the array and it lost its last caller |
| 5 | `softmax` | built and validated, then **removed** — the model does not use softmax |
| 6 | `rsqrt` LUT + `layernorm` | **dropped** — DyT replaced LayerNorm; `dyt` (`0x21`) needs no macro op |
| 7 | Full layer rewritten; re-measure against the phase-0 baseline | not started |
| 8 | Optional: MXU weight double-buffering (§4.5) | not started |

**Phase-0 baseline**, for phase 7 to measure against (8×8 array, 100 MHz sim clock):

| Program | run | mxu | mload | vpu | dma | swait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `relu_layer.tpu` | 1968 | 37 | 10 | 7 | 1856 (94%) | 1905 (97%) |
| `vector_add.tpu` | 6457 | 0 | 0 | 21 | 6400 (99%) | 6424 |
| `tiled_matmul.tpu` (software) | — | 616 | 160 (26% of MXU) | 0 | 7328 | 7981 |
| `tiled_matmul_hw.tpu` (2 matmuls) | — | 582 | 160 | 0 | 8864 | 9451 |

Two things fall straight out and neither was visible before phase 0. Every kernel at this
size is **DMA-bound** — 94–99% of the run is the byte-at-a-time SRAM path, so the array
geometry is nowhere near the limiter yet. And **26% of MXU time is weight loading**
(`mload`/`mxu`), which is the §4.5 double-buffering opportunity quantified: it is worth
having, and it is worth roughly a quarter of MXU time, not more.

**Keep every primitive opcode.** `matmul` and the primitive VPU ops stay in the ISA at
their current encodings, so `tiled_matmul.tpu`, `vpu_matmul.tpu` and
their golden vectors remain a live regression suite the whole way through. That is what
makes each phase verifiable rather than a rewrite you hope is equivalent.

## 9. Risks and open questions

1. **Area.** 92% LUTs, and `mxu` is 56% of them. Phases 3 and 8 both grow it. If §4.4 comes
   back over budget, the `synth.md` §5 knobs are `TOK_W` first (the `resbuf[0:63][0:7]`
   int32 buffer is ~16k FFs alone — and §4.3 says you only need 24 tokens, so `TOK_W=5`
   halves it for free), then 64-byte operand alignment to delete the barrel rotates.
   **`TOK_W = 5` is probably the cleanest way to pay for this whole proposal.**

2. **Decode with a KV cache — the layout is a non-issue; the *runtime config* is the real
   requirement.**

   Preallocate `K[MAX_T][d]` and `V[MAX_T][d]` at fixed scratchpad bases and write token
   `t`'s row at `base + t*d`. Then:

   - **The write** is a projection matmul with `t_len=1` whose `out_addr` is a register
     (`adds` from a step counter). Registers already hold addresses — nothing new.
   - **The read** is rows `0 .. t` of a fixed row-major tensor at a constant stride `d`.
     Contiguous, and exactly the `base + count + stride` shape §4.1 and §5.3 already
     express. Nothing ragged about it.
   - **Capacity** is not a constraint: at `d = 128`, even `MAX_T = 64` is 8 KB each for K
     and V against a 64 KB scratchpad.
   - **Causal masking comes free**, and is already the intended approach — iterate `j ≤ i`
     rather than materializing the `-1e9` mask (`scalar_unit.md` §5).

   What decode *does* require is that `vcols = t+1` change every step. Config registers are
   `setcfg`-immediate-only today, so **`setcfgr` (§3) is the actual prerequisite**, not any
   change to the address generators. It is ~20 LUTs. Add it in phase 1 and decode stays
   open at essentially no cost — this is much cheaper than the "decide now, expensive to
   retrofit" tradeoff an earlier draft of this section claimed.

   The genuinely rigid thing is narrower: the strides are *runtime* values but the **tensor
   layout convention** (activations row-major int8, weights column-major 2-bit packed) is
   compiled into the address arithmetic. A layout change is a retrofit; a shape change is
   a `setcfgr`.

3. **Decode is weight-load bound, and that is a result rather than a defect.** With
   `t_len = 1`, each projection pays a full `LOAD` (COLS cycles) plus pipeline drain
   (~ROWS cycles) to push one token row, so MXU utilization is roughly `1/(ROWS+COLS)` —
   about 6% at the board's 8×8. The §4.5 weight double-buffer does not help, because there
   is no activation stream to hide the load behind.

   This is the standard prefill-vs-decode arithmetic-intensity split, and it is precisely
   the kind of thing the phase-0 counters (§7) exist to show. Do not design around it —
   measure it, and let `mxu_load_cycles` versus `mxu_busy_cycles` make the point on a
   roofline.

4. **`rsqrt` LUT precision.** A 256-entry int8 table over the variance range may be too
   coarse for LayerNorm to match `nn.LayerNorm` acceptably. Validate against `torch_ref.py`
   **before** committing the RTL. Fallback: keep `layernorm` decomposed and accept the
   instruction cost — it is 2 per layer, not 2 per row.

5. **`vecmatmul` cost.** It removes ~120 instruction words but does not make attention
   faster; it is still `vrows²` VPU dot products. If phase-0 counters show attention
   dominating `vpu_busy_cycles`, the real answer is an int8×int8 mode in the MXU, which is
   a much larger change (the PE is a select+conditional-negate adder, not a multiplier)
   and is out of scope here. Measure before deciding.

   > **Resolved, and this risk was real:** the counters showed 36.4% of the run in
   > `vecmatmul` (§7). The answer was not an int8×int8 MXU but the mirror image of one —
   > narrow the *activation* to the weight width instead of widening the weight path.
   > `QUANT4` packs K and V to int4, both matmuls became `matmul_t`, and `vecmatmul` was
   > deleted.

6. **`softmax` operand count.** Three addresses plus `cfg vscalar` is the ceiling of what
   the encoding holds. If a macro op ever needs a fourth address, that is the signal the
   instruction format — not the op — needs revisiting.
