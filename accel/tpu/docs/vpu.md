# VPU — Vector Unit

SIMD unit for every pointwise / reduction operation that is not a ternary-weight matmul.
See [README](README.md) §3 for the high-level role.

## Scope

The VPU owns every pointwise / reduction op the shipped model needs, and **only** those.
It was cut down to that set: `GELU`, `EXP`, `SQUARE`, `ELEMENT_MUL`, `SCALAR_MUL`,
`SCALAR_ADD`, `SCALAR_DIV`, `REDUCEMAX`, `REDUCESUM` and the `SOFTMAX` macro op were
removed, along with the two activation ROMs and the restoring divider. See
[Removed ops](#removed-ops).

What is left:

- **Activations:** ReLU. (The FFN is `ReLU`, not GELU — `model/transformer.py`.)
- **Elementwise arithmetic:** vector add — the residuals `X + O` and `X1 + F`.
- **Narrowing:** `REQUANT` (int32 → int8) and `DYT` (the same rescale, symmetric clip),
  which is how DyT normalization costs no pass of its own.
- **The mask and the ReLU, but no longer the attention matmuls.** There is **no
  softmax**: the model uses ReLU attention, so `relu(S + mask)` is a `vecadd` against
  an int8 mask and a `RELU`, both here. `QK^T` and `PV` used to be here too, as the
  `VECMATMUL` macro op — a serial `DOT` per (query, key) pair, and the slowest thing
  in the shipped kernel. They are now on the [MXU](mxu.md), because K and V are
  packed to int4 by `QUANT4` and an int4 activation is a legal weight operand. The
  output head followed once `Model.fc` became an `Int4Linear`, which left `VECMATMUL`
  with **no caller at all** — and it has since been **removed**, along with the
  geometry inputs and the `vpu_mm_busy` perf event that existed only for it.
  `DOT` stayed. It has no caller either, but it *is* the reduction path (accumulator,
  lane fold, scalar store) and the only int8 × int8 reduction the ISA has, so it is
  what an int8 × int8 model shape would be rebuilt from; restoring the macro op means
  re-adding the wrapper, not the datapath.

## Operations

The op is selected by the 5-bit `vpu_op` field driven by the scalar unit, matching the
`VOP_*` values in `scalar_unit.sv` and `vpu.sv`.

| `vpu_op` | Name        | Kind        | Operands used            | Result                                       |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `0`      | `DOT`       | reduction   | `src0`, `src1`           | scalar `Σ src0[i]·src1[i]` → `dst`           |
| `1`      | `ADD`       | elementwise | `src0`, `src1`           | `dst[i] = src0[i] + src1[i]`                 |
| `3`      | `RELU`      | elementwise | `src0`                   | `dst[i] = max(src0[i], 0)`                   |
| `10`     | `REQUANT`   | requant     | `src0`(int32), `scalar`  | `dst[i] = clip((src0[i]·m0 + rnd) >> n)`     |
| `16`     | `DYT`       | requant     | `src0`(int32), `scalar`  | `dst[i] = clip±127((src0[i]·m0 + rnd) >> n)` |
| `17`     | `QUANT4`    | requant     | `src0`(**int8**), `scalar` | `dst[i] = clip[-8,7]((src0[i]·m0 + rnd) >> n)`, 4 bits wide |

The gaps (`2`, `4`–`9`, `11`–`15`) are retired codes, not free encoding
space — see [Removed ops](#removed-ops). They are left vacant so a stale binary decodes
to an unknown op rather than a different one.

`DOT` is the only reduction: it collapses the vector to one int32 scalar at `dst`. Every
other op produces a same-length vector. No shipped kernel issues `vecdot`; it is kept
because it is the reduction datapath itself and the only int8 × int8 reduction the ISA
has, and it costs one decode arm.

### Removed ops

These were implemented and are now gone. They served a softmax-attention, LayerNorm,
GELU-FFN model; `model/transformer.py` is ReLU attention, DyT normalization and a ReLU
feed-forward, so by the time the shipped kernel
([`adder_model.tpu`](../../tpulang/examples/adder_model.tpu)) was written not one of
them had a caller.

| Removed | Was for | Went with it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GELU` (4), `EXP` (6) | GELU FFN; softmax's `exp` | both 256×int8 ROMs, `rtl/luts/*.hex`, `accel/tpulang/luts.py`, the `GELU_INIT`/`EXP_INIT` parameters through `tpu_top.sv` and the board wrapper |
| `SQUARE` (5) | LayerNorm variance | — |
| `ELEMENT_MUL` (9), `SCALAR_MUL` (2), `SCALAR_ADD` (11) | LayerNorm/softmax broadcasts | — |
| `SCALAR_DIV` (12) | softmax's `Σexp`, LayerNorm variance | the shared restoring divider, `recip_R`/`div_*` state, the `S_RECIP` state, and the `RECIP_Q`/`DIV_Q` parameters |
| `REDUCEMAX` (7), `REDUCESUM` (8) | softmax/LayerNorm statistics | the **max fold** in the reduction path — `acc` now always opens at zero, since `DOT` is the only reduction left |
| `SOFTMAX` (14), `SM_EXP` (15) | the fused row-wise softmax macro op | its whole four-pass sequencer (`sm_*`), and `cfg vscalar` (index 9), the config register only it read |
| `VECMATMUL` (13) | attention's `QK^T` and `PV`, before `QUANT4` put them on the array | its two-level pair counter and address steppers (`mm_*`), the five geometry inputs (`vrows`/`vcols`/`vrow0`/`vrow1`/`vcrow`, `cfg` 10–14), the `VPU_GEOM` command (`cmd_vpu.sv` `0x02`) that carried them, and `vpu_mm_busy` — `tpu_top.sv`'s counter 6 (`vmm`) is now tied low. **Not** `DOT`: the reduction datapath it wrapped is untouched |

Two ISA-level consequences. `cfg vscalar` is **retired but its index is not reused**:
renumbering `vrows`…`tdrow` would silently repoint every `setcfg` in every existing
program. And `vpu_scalar` is now unconditionally the third register operand, because
`SOFTMAX` — the one op whose three registers were `dst`/`src`/`tmp`, leaving no slot for
the requant word — was the reason that routing had a special case at all.

Measured on the trimmed unit, out-of-context synthesis of `vpu` alone
(`build.tcl mode=ooc module=vpu`, xc7a35t, ROWS=COLS=8):

| | LUTs | FFs | DSPs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| before | 10012 | 897 | 90 |
| after | **5162** | **667** | **32** |
| | −48.4% | −25.6% | −64.4% |

The DSP collapse is the headline and is not mysterious: `SCALAR_MUL`, `ELEMENT_MUL`,
`SQUARE` and `SCALAR_DIV`'s reciprocal multiply each wanted a per-lane multiplier, and
there are 16 lanes. What remains is `DOT`'s 8×8 product and the two narrowing ops'
`acc32 × m0`.

**What coming back would cost.** `softmax` is the one to think about before deleting
anything further: `model/transformer.py` still carries the comment *"revert to softmax
if training bad"* next to its ReLU attention, and restoring it means restoring `EXP`
(and so the ROM, `luts.py` and the `$readmemh` plumbing), `REDUCEMAX`, `REDUCESUM`,
`SCALAR_DIV` with its divider, `SM_EXP`, the four-pass sequencer and `cfg vscalar` —
i.e. essentially this entire table. It is all recoverable from git history, but it is
not a one-line revert. LayerNorm would additionally want `SQUARE` back.

`vecmatmul` is the cheap one to bring back by comparison: `DOT` is still here, so it is
the wrapper — the pair counter, the address steppers, the geometry command — and not
any datapath. It is only worth doing for a model shape whose attention operand cannot
be narrowed to int4, since on this one the array does the same work far faster.

### Datatypes and requant

Compute ops read **int8** operands, accumulate in **int32**, and write their **int32**
result straight to scratchpad — the VPU does *not* narrow on the writeback path.
Narrowing int32 → int8 is the job of the explicit **`REQUANT`** instruction, which
applies the BitNet fixed-point rescale

```
dst[i] = clip_int8( (src0[i] * m0 + (1 << (n-1))) >> n )
```

the same arithmetic as [`requant.sv`](../rtl/requant.sv), with the per-tensor multiplier
`m0` (`M0_W` bits) and shift `n` (`N_W` bits) packed into the 32-bit word at the
`scalar` address (`m0` in the low bits, `n` above). Keeping requant a separate op lets
the scalar unit hold the residual stream at full int32 precision and requantize **only
where an int8 activation is actually consumed** — e.g. right before an MXU matmul —
instead of clipping after every pointwise op. The result scale is chosen entirely by
`m0`/`n`, so a producer emits its result already in the consumer's scale. That is the
only mechanism left for reconciling a residual add whose operands differ in scale:
`ADD` takes two int8 operands at one scale, so the producer's `REQUANT` has to land on
it (`adder_kernel.md` §4 — this is what pins `RQ_O` and `RQ_F`).

### DyT (`DYT`)

`DYT` is the same instruction with the clip moved: `-127` instead of `-128`.

```
dst[i] = clip_±127( (src0[i] * m0 + (1 << (n-1))) >> n )
```

That one constant is the whole op, and the reason it exists is that it turns a
*normalization* into an instruction the datapath already had. DyT
([arxiv 2503.10622](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622)) is
`hardtanh(alpha·x, -1, 1)` with one learned scalar — the drop-in LayerNorm
replacement `model/transformer.py` uses. Pin the output scale to `1/127` and
fold `alpha` into the multiplier, and the saturation of a narrow *is* the
hardtanh: every value the clip catches is exactly one hardtanh would have
flattened to ±1. The clip has to be symmetric because hardtanh is odd; int8's
`-128` would put the saturated end at `-1.0079`.

The consequence for a kernel is that DyT costs **zero extra passes**: a
normalization always follows a residual add, and that add's result was going to
be narrowed from int32 to int8 anyway. See
`accel/tpulang/adder_kernel.md` §4 and `examples/adder_model.tpu`, where the two
`dyt`s replace two `requant`s and nothing else changes.

Nothing checks that the output scale really is `1/127`. A `DYT` whose word
targets some other scale is a rescale with an odd clip, not a hardtanh — the
scale contract is the compiler's.

### int4 narrow + pack (`QUANT4`, formerly `TQUANT`)

The third op on the same shifter, and the only one whose destination is not int8:

```
dst[i] = clip_[-8,7]( (src0[i] * m0 + (1 << (n-1))) >> n )   # 4 bits per element
```

Two differences from `REQUANT`, and both are the point:

- **the source is int8**, not int32. `QUANT4` narrows an activation a requant already
  produced, so it does not read the accumulator width. It is the one op in the unit
  where `src0_is32` and `dst_is8` are genuinely independent predicates rather than two
  names for the same thing.
- **the destination is 4 bits**, a bare two's-complement nibble in the MXU's packed
  weight layout ([scratchpad.md](scratchpad.md) §2), two elements to a byte. So the
  result is not "an int4 tensor that then needs packing"; it *is* a packed weight
  block, addressable by `matmul_t` with no pass in between.

That is what lets an **activation be a weight operand**, which is the whole reason the
op exists: the array reads weights packed and activations as bytes, so attention's
`Q @ K^T` and `P @ V` can only run on it once K and V are in the packed layout.
`accel/tpulang/examples/adder_model.tpu` packs both, one `quant4` loop each, and in
exchange both attention matmuls became `matmul_t` dispatches.

Since weights and activations are now the same width, the *value* is usually unchanged —
whatever requant produced `src0` already clipped it to `[-8, 7]`, so `{m0,n} = {1,0}`
makes this a pure repack. Under the old ternary encoding it was a genuine second narrow
onto `{-1, 0, 1}`, and that rounding was real accuracy loss.

Two constraints a kernel has to respect:

- **`vlen` must be a multiple of 2** (it was 4 when four trits shared a byte). The write
  strobe is per byte and a byte holds two nibbles. A tail that does not fill its byte
  writes nibble `0` into the remaining slot rather than preserving what was there.
- **the destination pointer advances half as fast as the source.** A `CHUNK`-long pass
  reads `CHUNK` bytes and writes `CHUNK/2`.

Nothing checks that the multiplier is a sensible ternary threshold, exactly as with
`DYT`. A word that is too large makes every element ±1 and a word that is too small
makes every element 0; both are legal instructions and neither is a matmul worth
running.

## Interface

The VPU is a slave of the [scalar unit](scalar_unit.md): the scalar unit dispatches one
op and blocks on `done` (issue-and-wait, scalar_unit.md §2). The VPU owns the `V_rw`
scratchpad port for the duration of the op.

### Control (scalar-unit side)

| Signal      | Dir | Width     | Meaning                                             |
| ----------- | --- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `vpu_start` | in  | 1         | pulse: latch operands and begin (ignored if busy)   |
| `vpu_op`    | in  | 5         | operation selector (table above)                    |
| `vpu_src0`  | in  | `ADDR_W`  | byte address of source vector 0                     |
| `vpu_src1`  | in  | `ADDR_W`  | byte address of source vector 1 (binary ops)        |
| `vpu_scalar`| in  | `ADDR_W`  | byte address of the `{m0,n}` word (`REQUANT`/`DYT`) |
| `vpu_dst`   | in  | `ADDR_W`  | byte address of the destination                     |
| `vpu_vlen`  | in  | 10        | vector length in elements (config reg, ≤ 1023)      |
| `vpu_busy`  | out | 1         | high from `start` until the op retires              |
| `vpu_done`  | out | 1         | one-cycle pulse when the result is fully written    |

There is no geometry on this interface and no `vpu_mm_busy`: both existed only for
`VECMATMUL`, and went with it. `tpu_top.sv`'s counter 6 (`vmm`) is now tied low and
kept as a retired slot so the UART `'T'` reply does not renumber.

All addresses are byte offsets into the scratchpad and are captured on `vpu_start`, so
the scalar unit may reuse its register file immediately after issue.

### Scratchpad `V_rw` port (SIMD)

The lane count is int32-limited: `LANES = SCRATCHPAD_W/4`, where `SCRATCHPAD_W` is the
port width **in bytes**. `tpu_top`'s default `VPU_BYTES = 64` (512-bit) gives
`LANES = 16`, and that is the width this doc's examples use.

> **The Cmod A7 build is half that.** `boards/cmod_a7/board.tcl` sets `VPU_BYTES = 32`
> (256-bit), so the synthesized VPU has **`LANES = 8`**. Everything below holds with 8
> substituted for 16; only the chunk count changes, since a vector longer than `LANES` is
> streamed either way. The VPU is 4.5k LUTs and 48 of the design's 67 DSPs even at 8 lanes
> (`synth.md` §5), which is why it is not 16.

int32 operands/results use the full width (`LANES·32` bits); int8
operands/results occupy the low `LANES` bytes of an access, so int8 and int32 byte
strides differ (an int8 chunk advances `LANES` bytes, an int32 chunk `LANES·4`). The
port is a single logical read/modify/write port, so reads and writes are issued on
separate cycles by the FSM.

| Signal     | Dir | Width           | Meaning                                             |
| ---------- | --- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `V_re`     | out | 1               | read enable (address valid this cycle)              |
| `V_raddr`  | out | `ADDR_W`        | read byte address                                   |
| `V_rdata`  | in  | `SCRATCHPAD_W·8`| one int8 chunk, valid the cycle **after** `V_re`    |
| `V_we`     | out | 1               | write enable                                        |
| `V_waddr`  | out | `ADDR_W`        | write byte address                                  |
| `V_wdata`  | out | `SCRATCHPAD_W·8`| int8 chunk (or int32 scalar in the low 4 bytes)     |
| `V_wstrb`  | out | `SCRATCHPAD_W`  | per-byte write strobe (partial tail / scalar write) |

The memory contract matches the scalar unit's: synchronous read, data valid one cycle
after `V_re`; writes complete in the asserting cycle under `V_wstrb`.

### Handshake and streaming

```
   start                            done
     │   read src0   read src1        │
 idle ──► RD0 ──► RD1 ──► EXEC ──► ... ──► idle
              (per LANES-element chunk, looped ceil(vlen/LANES) times)
```

A vector longer than `LANES` is streamed in chunks: the FSM reads a chunk of each
operand, computes all lanes in one cycle, and either writes the chunk back (elementwise
/ requant) or folds it into a running int32 accumulator (reduction). Source/destination
pointers advance by the element stride per chunk (§Scratchpad port); a partial final
chunk is masked by `V_wstrb` and by a lane-active predicate so out-of-range lanes never
contribute to a reduction. The `SCALAR_MUL` multiplier / `REQUANT` `{m0,n}` word is read
once, on the first chunk, and held. When the last chunk
retires — writing the final elementwise chunk, or the single int32 reduction scalar to
`dst` — the VPU pulses `vpu_done` for one cycle and drops `vpu_busy`.
