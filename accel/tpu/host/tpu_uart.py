"""Host-side driver for the TPU's UART command link (``rtl/uart_interface.sv``).

The FPGA is a pure slave: the host sends a fixed-header command frame and the
device answers. Five commands, four of them with a 3-byte big-endian address
field:

===== ====== ============= ========================== =====================
CMD   byte   frame                                    reply
===== ====== ============= ========================== =====================
``R`` 0x52   read  SRAM    ``CMD A2 A1 A0 L1 L0``      ``len`` data bytes
``W`` 0x57   write SRAM    ``CMD A2 A1 A0 L1 L0`` +    ACK / NAK
                           ``data[len]``
``I`` 0x49   write IMEM    ``CMD A2 A1 A0 L1 L0`` +    ACK / NAK
                           ``data[len]``
``G`` 0x47   go / run      ``CMD A2 A1 A0``            ACK / NAK
``T`` 0x54   read timer    ``CMD``                     4 counter bytes
===== ====== ============= ========================== =====================

* ``R``/``W`` addresses are 19-bit external-SRAM byte addresses; ``len`` is a
  byte count in ``1..65535``.
* ``I`` addresses are *instruction word indices* (13-bit); ``len`` is still in
  **bytes** and must be a multiple of 4. Each word is sent MSB first. The top
  bit (:data:`FW_BASE`) selects the producer: clear for the scalar unit's IMEM
  (1024 words), set for the PicoRV32's firmware RAM (4096 words).
* ``G`` carries no length and no payload — it starts whichever producer the
  same top bit selects: the scalar unit at ``run_pc = addr``, or the CPU, which
  always resets to firmware address 0 (``PROGADDR_RESET`` is fixed in the RTL,
  so the rest of the address is ignored).
* ``T`` is a single byte and cannot fail: it returns the scalar unit's
  run-length counter (``rtl/cycle_timer.sv``) as 4 bytes MSB first — the core
  clocks the last run took, or how far the current one has got.
* Read replies are header-less: the host already knows ``len`` and simply reads
  that many bytes. A *rejected* read answers with a lone NAK instead.

Two device behaviours drive the design here:

**Rejected commands do not consume the data phase.** The FSM validates right
after the header and, on failure, sends NAK and returns to IDLE — so payload
bytes the host had already queued would be re-decoded as fresh command bytes.
Every command is therefore validated host-side against the exact same rules the
RTL applies (:func:`_check_mem`, :func:`_check_imem`) before a single byte goes
out, and a NAK on a write is treated as a desync (the link is drained and the
error raised) rather than a routine error.

**The core has priority.** Any command arriving while the scalar unit is running
is NAK'd and touches nothing, so preload/readback only works while the core is
idle. ``T`` is the exception — it reads a counter and contends over nothing, so
it is answered at any time. There is still no ``busy``/``done`` status command:
:meth:`TPUUart.read_timer` tells you how long the core has been running, not
whether it has stopped (the count also sits still if the run never started), so
completion is inferred as before, from a command that stops being NAK'd.

Both failure modes are byte-level, so the driver can log every byte it moves
(see :class:`UartTrace`)::

    with TPUUart("COM3", trace=True) as tpu:    # live hexdump to stderr
        tpu.go(0)

    tpu = TPUUart("COM3", trace=UartTrace(sink=None))   # record silently
    ...
    tpu.dump_trace()                            # print it after the fact

From the CLI, ``--trace`` / ``--trace-file FILE``.

Requires ``pyserial``.

        USB-serial bridge is still shifting a frame out corrupts the byte in
        flight: the host's IN requests disturb the transmitter's bit timing by
        about half a bit, so the device samples that byte on its bit boundaries
        and decodes ``sent[k]`` or ``sent[k-1]`` for every bit k. In practice
        that is one mangled byte per command, and because the read is issued
        the moment the write returns, it lands in the first few bytes — i.e.
        the header, where a wrong length or address does the most damage. A
        16-bit length field that comes out one bit left-shifted is why the
        device used to "send more bytes than the host asked for".

        Measured on a Cmod A7 (FT2232H, 115200 8N1) with the echo image, which
        reports every received byte: reading immediately corrupted 72/6400
        bytes, all in burst positions 1..6; sleeping past the burst first
        corrupted 0/6400; sleeping over only the first half moved the damage to
        positions 33..46, i.e. exactly where the read began. The FPGA is not
        involved — the same RTL decodes a bit-identical stream perfectly in
        simulation, and the fault reproduces on all three board images.

        ``flush()`` is not enough on its own: on Windows it returns once the
        bytes reach the driver, not once they reach the wire. There is no API
        that reports the UART shift register, so the wire time is computed and
