# ---- Core clock ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Same 12 MHz oscillator straight into the core as boards/cmod_a7 — the echo
# image must run the receiver at the identical divisor, or it is not measuring
# the same thing. build.tcl re-derives UART_CPB if clk_mhz= or baud= is passed.

# ---- Echo block length --------------------------------------------------------
# Bytes buffered per exchange: the device receives this many, then sends them
# back. host/uart_echo.py's --block must match — nothing on the wire negotiates
# it. See rtl/uart_echo.sv.

# ---- Geometry placeholders ----------------------------------------------------
# There is no TPU core in this image — no MXU, no scratchpad, no external SRAM.
# These exist only because build.tcl's banner prints them unconditionally; they
# are not passed to the top level (board_generics below does not list them), so
# the zeros in the banner are accurate: this image has none of it.

# filter anything else out with a note, but keeping the list honest means the
# note stays empty and a real typo is visible.

# Cmod A7 boots from a 4 MB Spansion S25FL032 QSPI part. Writing the *echo* image
# to flash would make the board come up as a self-test rig every power-on, which
# is almost never what you want — build mode=bit and program volatile instead.
