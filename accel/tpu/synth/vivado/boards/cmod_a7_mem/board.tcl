# Shares constraints/cmod_a7.xdc with the production image rather than taking a
# copy. cmod_a7_mem_top declares exactly the same ports as cmod_a7_top -- same
# names, same widths -- so every set_property in that file resolves, and the two
# images are guaranteed the identical pinout. That matters: the SRAM pins
# switching next to the J17/J18 UART pair is part of what is under test, so a
# divergent pin assignment would quietly invalidate the comparison.

# ---- Core clock ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Same 12 MHz oscillator straight into the core as boards/cmod_a7 -- this image

# thing. build.tcl re-derives UART_CPB if clk_mhz= or baud= is passed.

# ---- External SRAM ------------------------------------------------------------
# Cmod A7 cellular SRAM: 512K x 8. Must match the 19 address / 8 data lines in
# constraints/cmod_a7.xdc, and matches boards/cmod_a7 so the controller behaves
# identically in both images.

# There is no TPU core in this image -- no MXU, no VPU, no scratchpad. These
# exist only because build.tcl's banner prints them unconditionally; they are not
# passed to the top level (board_generics below does not list them), so the zeros
# in the banner are accurate: this image has none of it.

# filter anything else out with a note, but keeping the list honest means the
# note stays empty and a real typo is visible.

# uart_interface's mid-frame abort out of the design, and this image exists to

# one-off experiment, not a default:
#
#   vivado -mode batch -source build.tcl -tclargs board=cmod_a7_mem mode=deploy
# then edit the 0 below, or add rx_timeout to build.tcl's ARGMAP if it becomes
# something you sweep.

# to flash would make the board come up as a bring-up rig every power-on, which
# is almost never what you want -- build mode=deploy and program volatile instead.
