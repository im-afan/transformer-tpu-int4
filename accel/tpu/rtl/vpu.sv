// vpu.sv — TPU SIMD vector unit
//
// Implements the block described in accel/tpu/docs/vpu.md: LANES int32 lanes fed
// from a single wide scratchpad read/modify/write port (V_rw), computing every
// pointwise / reduction op that is not an int4-weight matmul.
//
// SCOPE. This unit implements exactly these ops and nothing else:
//
//     VOP_DOT  VOP_ADD  VOP_RELU  VOP_REQUANT  VOP_DYT  VOP_QUANT4
//
// **VOP_VECMATMUL was removed.** It sequenced one VOP_DOT per (row, col) pair,
// and it was how attention's Q@K^T and P@V ran before K and V were packed to
// int4 (VOP_QUANT4) and both matmuls moved onto the array; making Model.fc an
// Int4Linear took the output head, its last caller, with them. Gone with it:
// the macro-op sequencer (the `mm_*` registers), the five geometry inputs it
// was the only reader of, and `vpu_mm_busy`, the perf event that measured its
// share of VPU time. Opcode 13 is a retired hole, not free space.
//
// VOP_DOT stayed. No shipped kernel issues `vecdot` either, but it *is* the
// reduction path — the accumulator, the lane fold and the S_WB scalar store —
// and it is the only int8 x int8 reduction the ISA has, which is what a model
// shape needing an int8 x int8 matmul would be rebuilt from. Restoring the
// macro op means re-adding the wrapper, not the datapath.
//
// Everything else was removed deliberately (GELU, EXP, SQUARE, ELEMENT_MUL,
// SCALAR_MUL/ADD/DIV, REDUCEMAX, REDUCESUM, SOFTMAX and its fused SM_EXP), along
// with the two 256-entry activation ROMs and the restoring divider that only
// SCALAR_DIV needed. They existed for a softmax-attention, LayerNorm, GELU-FFN
// model; model/transformer.py is now ReLU attention, DyT normalization and a
// ReLU feed-forward, so none of them had a caller. See docs/vpu.md §Removed ops
// for the list and for what coming back would cost.
//
// **The reduction path is now sum-only.** VOP_DOT is the sole reduction, so
// there is no max fold and `acc` always starts at zero. Restoring REDUCEMAX
// means restoring both.
//
// Dispatched by the scalar unit (scalar_unit.sv) with the issue-and-wait
// handshake: pulse `vpu_start`, then block on `vpu_done`. The op selector
// `vpu_op` matches VOP_* in scalar_unit.sv.
//
// Numerics / requant. Compute ops read int8 operands, accumulate in int32, and
// write their **int32** result straight to scratchpad — the VPU no longer
// narrows on the writeback path. Going int32 -> int4 is an *explicit*
// instruction, VOP_REQUANT, which applies the fixed-point rescale
// `clip((acc*m0 + round) >> n)` with a per-tensor {m0, n} read from the scalar
// operand. This lets the scalar unit keep the residual stream wide and
// requantize only where a narrow activation is actually needed (e.g. before
// feeding the MXU).
//
// **The narrow lands int4, in an int8 container.** REQUANT and DYT still write
// one byte per element and every activation buffer is still byte-per-element;
// only the value range narrows, to [-8, 7] and [-7, 7] respectively. Clipping
// there rather than at int8 is what keeps mxu.sv's PSUM_W bound true — see the
// numerics note in that file.
//
// DyT (VOP_DYT). Dynamic tanh — `hardtanh(alpha*x, -1, 1)`, arxiv 2503.10622 —
// is the normalization model/transformer.py uses in place of LayerNorm, and on
// a narrow integer datapath it is *the same instruction as a requant with a
// different clip*. If the output scale is pinned to 1/7 then a saturating narrow
// from int32 already computes the hardtanh: the multiplier `m0/2**n` carries
// `alpha * s_in * 7`, and every value the clip catches is exactly one that
// hardtanh would have flattened to +-1. The only difference from VOP_REQUANT is
// the *lower* bound, -7 instead of int4's -8: hardtanh is an odd function,
// so a floor of -8/7 = -1.143 would be off-spec at one end only. One
// comparison constant is the whole cost of the op, and having it be an op at
// all is what lets a kernel say "this is a normalization" instead of "this is a
// rescale that happens to clip". See accel/tpulang/adder_kernel.md §4.
//
// int4 narrow + pack (VOP_QUANT4, opcode 0x22, formerly `tquant`). The third op
// sharing that fixed point, and the only one whose *destination* is not int8: it
// clips to [-8, 7] and writes a bare 4-bit two's-complement nibble, two elements
// per byte, which is the MXU's packed weight layout. That is what makes the
// result directly addressable as a `matmul_t` weight row, with no repacking pass
// and no host round trip — and therefore what lets an *activation* be a weight
// operand. The shipped kernel packs K and V with it, which is how attention's
// Q@K^T and P@V left the VPU (one serial dot product per output element) for
// the array, and therefore why VOP_VECMATMUL could be deleted.
//
// Now that weights and activations are the same width this is usually a pure
// repack — the source was already clipped to [-8, 7] by whatever requant
// produced it, so `{m0,n} = {1,0}` is lossless. Under the ternary encoding it
// was a genuine second narrow onto {-1, 0, 1}.
//
// Its write strobe is per byte, so `vpu_vlen` must be a multiple of 2 (it was 4
// when four trits shared a byte); a partial final byte writes nibble 0 into the
// slot the tail did not fill rather than preserving what was there.
//
// The scalar operand. VOP_REQUANT, VOP_DYT and VOP_QUANT4 are the only ops that
// use `vpu_rq_word`, and all three use the same thing: one {m0, n} pair, latched
// at dispatch and held for the whole vector. It used to be a scratchpad address
// that cost a two-state fetch over the V port before the first chunk; it is now
// a 16-bit literal in the command (docs/picorv32_migration.md §3).
//
// Streaming: a vector of `vpu_vlen` elements is processed LANES elements at a
// time. Each chunk reads its operand(s), computes all lanes in one cycle, then
// either writes the chunk back (elementwise / requant) or folds it into a
// running int32 accumulator (reduction). A partial tail chunk is masked by a
// lane-active predicate and by V_wstrb.
//
// Element widths on the 512-bit port: int8 operands occupy the low LANES bytes
// of an access; int32 operands/results occupy the full width (LANES*32 bits).
// Source/destination byte strides therefore differ per op (see *_stride below).
//
// Memory contract (matches scalar_unit.sv): synchronous read — address/enable
// presented one cycle, V_rdata valid the next; writes complete in one cycle
// under V_wstrb.
