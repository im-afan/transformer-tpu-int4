# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A small decoder-style transformer trained to do multi-digit **addition** (a character-level
sequence model), plus custom hardware/backend accelerators for its core attention/matmul ops.
The PyTorch model in `model/` is the **golden reference**; every accelerator in `accel/` is
validated numerically against it.

The current front line is the TPU, and it is **caught up with the model**.
[`accel/tpu/fw/adder.c`](accel/tpu/fw/adder.c) runs the whole int4 adder model —
four transformer layers plus the output head — as one firmware kernel, 534
commands and 1992 bytes of RISC-V, verified against the ISS and the RTL and
scored on the addition task:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `cd accel/tpu/tb && make fw FWPROG=adder` | 526 959 checks, **0 errors**, 453 778 clocks, 534/534 commands matched |
| `python accel/tpulang/adder_export.py -n 256` | **100.00% exact-sequence, 100.00% token** on `model/saved/int4_d64_f256_l4.pt`, identical to the PyTorch QAT model |

It is composed out of [`accel/tpu/fw/tpulib.h`](accel/tpu/fw/tpulib.h), a layer
of **size-independent primitives** over `tpu.h`'s single macro-ops: a matmul
that blocks in rows, columns and the contraction and stages whatever is in DRAM,
the chunked elementwise pairs, a transpose and 2-D block moves. Nothing in the
kernel depends on the model fitting in 64 KB of scratchpad any more; it fits, so
every activation stays resident and only the weights stream, which is a
*residency* choice the kernel makes rather than a constraint the code carries.
`fw/tiled.c` (`make fw FWPROG=tiled`) is the regression for the paths `adder.c`
does not take — DRAM to DRAM, undersized arena, all three block loops running —
and is checked against an independent Python matmul, not only against the ISS.

Everything is int4 now, weights *and* activations, on both sides: the RTL and
`iss.py` take **int4 weights in a row-major 4-bit packed layout** and every
narrow clips to `[-8, 7]`. Row-major inverted the attention transpose relative
to the retired ternary kernel — `P@V`'s weight operand is now the free one and
`Q@K^T`'s is the one needing the transposing DMA. `model/quant.py` and
`model/calibrate.py` are the last things still describing the ternary/int8
model and are stale against `model/transformer.py`.

How the model got here — the model is not int8-quantizable *post-hoc*, and QAT
is what fixed it — is [The int8
finding](#the-int8-finding-and-why-the-model-keeps-changing).

## Commands

Python is a package rooted at the repo, so **run from the repo root** with `-m` so imports
resolve (`import model.transformer`, etc.):

```bash
python -m model.train --arch int4_vanilla       # train (arch: vanilla | gqa | int4_vanilla)
python -m model.tests.test_inference --arch int4 --model-path model/saved/colab_ternary_mha_small.pt
python -m model.calibrate --model-path model/saved/colab_ternary_mha_small.pt   # int8 act scales
python -m model.quant --model-path model/saved/ternary_mha.pt  # int8 accuracy bench
python accel/cuda/tests/test_cuda_mha.py        # CUDA kernel vs. its own reference — needs a GPU
```

`model/quant.py` is the **hardware-exact** int8 benchmark: integers end to end, one
`clip_int8((acc*m0 + 2**(n-1)) >> n)` requant per site, so its accuracy number is what the TPU
would score rather than an estimate. `model/calibrate.py` is the *fake-quant* path
(`TernaryLinear.quantize_activations`, float32 throughout) and answers a different, weaker
question. Useful flags: `--check` (instrumented forward vs `Model.forward`), `--fake-quant`
(the same scheme in float — if it disagrees with the integer run, the fixed-point code is the
suspect, not the model), `--words`, `--dynamic-range`, `--dyt-scale calibrated`.

The numbers below are the **PTQ-era** ones and are still what that checkpoint scores; the
last `model/saved/ternary_mha.pt` (QAT, `layers=2`) scored 100.00% / 100.00% instead — see
[The int8 finding](#the-int8-finding-and-why-the-model-keeps-changing).

**Measured on `colab_ternary_mha_small_dyt.pt` (256 problems): float 93.36% exact-sequence /
99.59% token, int8 activations 0.00% / 51.56%.** The fake-quant cross-check lands on
0.00% / 51.52%, so this is the scheme, not the arithmetic. Mechanism: DyT saturates
*completely* — `x`/`x1`/`x2` all have median = max = 1.0, i.e. the residual stream is a sign
vector — while `Wo(A)` grows unbounded with depth, so the two addends of the attention
residual differ by 9.6x at L0 and **3630x at L3**. `vecadd` takes two int8 operands at one
scale, so pinning to `s_x` clips 71% of `O` (92% at L3). This is `adder_kernel.md` §8.1's
finding with a sharper mechanism: DyT bounds the residual stream but nothing bounds what is
added to it.

**`model/saved/int4_d64_f256_l4.pt` is the live checkpoint** — the `adder_int4_vanilla`
retrain, QAT throughout, **100.00% exact-sequence / 100.00% token** over 256 problems both
in PyTorch and through `accel/tpu/fw/adder.c` on the ISS. It is what
`accel/tpulang/adder_export.py` defaults to. Untracked, like every checkpoint here.

`model/saved/ternary_mha.pt` is the last *ternary* QAT checkpoint (2 layers) and
**predates ternary K/V, the removal of the positional encoding, the ternary output head
and `layers=4`**. It no longer loads at all: `fc.weight` is an unexpected key against a
`TernaryLinear` head. There is also **no ternary arch to retrain it with** —
`adder_ternary_vanilla` was replaced by `adder_int4_vanilla`, so restoring the
ternary/int8 path means restoring that factory (git history) first.
The three `colab_ternary_mha_small*.pt` are committed but **deleted in the working tree**, so
any command naming one fails with `FileNotFoundError` until it is restored from git; the old
`colab_vanilla_mha.pt` / `colab_gqa.pt` / `colab_ternary_mha.pt` were deleted. `test_inference.py`
defaults to `saved/colab_ternary_mha_small.pt`, which is wrong relative to the repo root — pass
`model/saved/...`.

`test_cuda_mha.py` JIT-compiles the CUDA kernel via `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load`, so it
needs a CUDA toolchain + GPU. It asserts max abs diff < 1e-2 against a **softmax** einsum
reference it defines inline — see the CUDA note below; it no longer matches the model.

The venv is checked in at `.venv/` (Python 3.12). There is no requirements.txt; deps are just
`torch` (+ jupyter for `model/notebook.ipynb`), plus `pyserial` for the FPGA host driver.

TPU stack. **There is no assembler and no `.tpu` language any more** — the TPU has
one command producer, PicoRV32 firmware in `accel/tpu/fw/`:

```bash
make -C accel/tpu/fw                        # C firmware -> matmul.hex (RISC-V gcc)
make -C accel/tpu/fw PROG=adder             # ...or tiled / mha / ffn / matmul_loop
make -C accel/tpu/fw trace PROG=adder       # the kernel's command trace, host cc only
python accel/tpulang/fw_vectors.py -t <trace> -o accel/tpu/tb/vectors_fw -k adder
python accel/tpu/host/run_fw_matmul.py --dry-run   # operands + reference, no board
cd accel/tpu/tb && make fw FWPROG=adder     # the kernel through the whole core (~3 min)
cd accel/tpu/tb && make fw FWPROG=tiled     # tpulib.h's block loops, ~20 s
cd accel/tpu/tb && make list                # RTL testbenches (Icarus)

python accel/tpulang/adder_export.py -n 256          # accuracy on the addition task
python accel/tpulang/adder_export.py --dump-rq -n 0  # the 16 requant words per layer
```

`make` targets in `tb/`: `sim` (default TB), `cosim` (host driver vs RTL over a
simulated UART), `fw` / `fwsweep` (C firmware; `fw` needs a RISC-V gcc, and
regenerates golden vectors from the kernel's own native trace first),
`echo`/`mem`/`bram` (bring-up images), `wave`, `list`, `all`.

## Architecture

**`model/transformer.py`** — the whole model. It has changed a lot recently; the shape below is
what is in the tree, not what `model/README.md` describes (that file is stale — see
[Stale docs](#stale-docs)).

- **5-D attention tensor layout.** Q/K/V are shaped `[batch, tokens, kv_heads, heads_per_q,
  head_dim]` (K/V drop the `heads_per_q` axis) rather than the usual flat head layout. GQA is
  expressed by broadcasting `kv_heads` over `heads_per_q`. The attention math is the einsum
  pair `"btkgh,bskh->btskg"` (scores) and `"btskg,bskh->btkgh"` (weighted values). This layout
  is the contract every accelerator implements.
- **ReLU attention, not softmax.** `P = relu(S + causal_mask)`, with the mask built as
  `triu(ones([T,T]) * -1e9, diagonal=1)`. There is no normalization over the source axis at
  all. (The comment in the code says "revert to softmax if training bad".)
- **Every activation is int4, K and V included.** The old `q_kt`/`q_vt` — a second narrow
  rounding K and V onto `{-1,0,1}` on top of the int8 `q_k`/`q_v` — are **gone**, and so is
  the `TernaryQuant` helper. They existed only because the MXU multiplies an int8 activation
  by a ternary *weight* and cannot multiply int8 by int8, so the operand landing on the
  weight side had to be a trit (`adder_kernel.md` §2.5). With weights and activations at the
  same width the second rounding does nothing but lose precision.
- **There is no positional encoding.** `Model.positional_encoding` is gone and
  `Model.forward` embeds and nothing else. The only position signal left is the causal
  mask; ReLU attention has no source-axis normalization, so the magnitude of `P @ V`
  carries the count of visible keys. The same removal under softmax would leave the
  model position-blind.
- **Attention is inlined.** The old `mha_torch` / `slow_mha_cuda` helpers are **gone**; the math
  now lives directly in `MultiHeadAttention.forward`. `use_custom_attention` still threads
  `Model.forward → Transformer → MultiHeadAttention.forward` but is **accepted and ignored** —
  there is no CUDA path from the model any more.
- **No LayerNorm.** Removed in `2f6e32f`; `norm1`/`norm2` are now `DyT` (dynamic tanh,
  arxiv 2503.10622) — `hardtanh(x * alpha)` with a single learned scalar and no gamma/beta.
  The committed `colab_ternary_mha_small_nobias.pt` predates DyT (it has *no* normalization at
  all); `colab_ternary_mha_small_dyt.pt` is the DyT run.
- **Double residual.** `MultiHeadAttention.forward` ends in `return O + X`, and
  `Transformer.forward` adds `X` again. Deliberate or not, the checkpoints were fitted to it,
  so a reimplementation must reproduce it.
- **The padding mask is threaded through and never applied.** `attn_mask` reaches
  `MultiHeadAttention.forward` and is unused; only the causal mask is applied.
- **int4 weights.** `Int4Linear` quantizes weights to `[-8, 7]` scaled by `absmax/7`, with
  `RoundClip` (now taking explicit `qmin`/`qmax`) providing the straight-through-estimator
  backward. The scale is **detached** — an absmax gradient lands entirely on one element —
  unlike `TernaryLinear`, whose absmean averages over the tensor and can stay live. The
  weight is `[in_dim, out_dim]` with `x @ w`, the *transpose* of `nn.Linear`, so int4 and
  float checkpoints are not interchangeable. `make_linear(..., use_int4)` selects it —
  **including `Model.fc`**. A float config (`adder_vanilla`, `adder_gqa`) still gets an
  `nn.Linear` head, which is the only thing `quantize_head` / `dynamic_fake_quant` still
  apply to. The head's output is never requantized — an argmax does not care about scale.
  `TernaryLinear` is retained but **no config builds one**; it is what `model/quant.py` and
  the `accel/` export path import.
- **int4 activation quantization is QAT, not post-hoc.** Every requant site is an
  `ActQuant` module holding one per-tensor scale, learned by LSQ (`FakeQuant` implements the
  straight-through input gradient and the analytic scale gradient). Sites the hardware *pins*
  to another tensor's scale share one `ActQuant` **instance** — `q_o`/`q_xo` are the residual
  stream's `x_quant`, `q_p is q_s`, `q_hr is q_h` — so the sharing in `__init__` is load-bearing,
  not a shorthand. The default grid is `INT4_QMIN, INT4_QMAX = -8, 7`. DyT outputs are pinned
  to `fixed_scale=1/7` (`hardtanh` bounds them analytically) with `qmin=-7`, symmetric because
  hardtanh is odd. `set_quant_enabled(model, False)` turns them all off — **necessary to get a
  real float baseline**, since they are live by default. `TernaryLinear.act_scale` is the *old*
  PTQ buffer and is vestigial; `model/calibrate.py` drives that dead path.
- **MoE is gone** — the `use_moe` expert FFN was removed, along with the vanilla/GQA checkpoints.
- **Named configs** at the bottom (`adder_vanilla`, `adder_gqa`, `adder_int4_vanilla`) are
  the source of truth for hyperparameters and are wired to the `--arch` choices in `train.py`.
  `adder_int4_vanilla` is `d=64, f=256, layers=4, q_heads=kv_heads=4` (so `head_dim=16`),
  `use_int4=True, use_bias=False`. The biases are off because the TPU's VPU has no
  row-broadcast operand (see the comment on that factory).
  It replaced `adder_ternary_vanilla` (`d=128, f=128`, ternary weights, int8 activations),
  and **the `accel/` stack has followed**: the MXU multiplies an int4 weight by an int4
  activation, `accel/tpu/fw/adder.c` is this exact shape, and
  `accel/tpulang/adder_export.py` scores it. `model/quant.py` and `model/calibrate.py`
  are the leftovers — both still describe the ternary/int8 model and both fail on the
  missing `adder_ternary_vanilla` rather than exporting something wrong.

**`model/numbers_data.py`** — synthetic dataset. Non-obvious invariants:

- **Fixed answer position.** `EQUALS_POS = 15` is the index of the first **answer digit** (`=`
  is at 14). Operands are padded so this holds regardless of operand length; `train.py` and
  `test_inference.py` slice with the constant rather than searching for `=`. Implies
  `max_digits ≤ 6` — at 7 digits the pad count goes negative and every slice silently shifts.
- Padding token is `'N'` (`PAD_ID = 12`); `tokenize` builds an additive `-1e9` attention mask
  from the pad positions (`mask + mask.T`) — which the model then ignores.
- Operand lengths are sampled uniformly over digit-count (`_sample_number`), not uniformly over
  value. Answer digits are most-significant-first (no reversed-digit trick).

**`model/train.py`** — `batch_size` vs `mini_batch_size` implements **gradient accumulation**
(`steps_per_batch = batch_size // mini_batch_size`); `optim.step()` only fires every
`steps_per_batch` micro-steps. **Gradient clipping** (`--grad_clip`, default 1.0) is applied to
the *accumulated* gradient immediately before the step — clipping each micro-batch instead
would bound the partial sums separately; the reported `grad_norm` mean/max/clipped counts are
the pre-clip norms. The loss spans `EQUALS_POS-1 : -1` against `EQUALS_POS:`, so the trailing
pad tokens are part of the objective on purpose. Checkpoints go to `model/saved/test_model_*.pt`,
keeping only the last 3 (gitignored; the committed `colab_*.pt` are not produced by this path).

## Accelerators (`accel/`)

- **`cuda/`** (`kernels.cu` + `bindings.cpp`) — hand-written CUDA MHA/GQA kernel. **Now out of
  sync with the model**: it implements *softmax* attention and the model does ReLU attention,
  and nothing in `model/` loads it any more. It still passes its own self-contained test. Treat
  it as legacy unless someone re-syncs it.
- **The VPU implements seven ops and nothing else.** `VOP_DOT`, `ADD`, `RELU`,
  `REQUANT`, `DYT`, `TQUANT`, `VECMATMUL`. `TQUANT` (`0x22`, `VOP_TQUANT = 17`) is the
  newest: `requant`'s fixed point clipped to +-1, written **2 bits wide** in the MXU's
  weight encoding, four elements to a byte — int8 in, a packed ternary weight column
  out. It is what lets an activation be a weight operand, and therefore what put
  attention's `Q@K^T` and `P@V` on the array. With `Model.fc` ternary too, `VECMATMUL`
  and `VOP_DOT` now have **no caller in the shipped kernel at all** — both are kept
  for the model shape that needs an int8 x int8 matmul, and dropping them would mean
  dropping the whole reduction path plus its counter block, which is an area decision
  rather than a deletion. Its `vlen` must be a multiple of 4 (the write strobe is per
  byte) and its destination advances a quarter as fast as its source. `GELU`, `EXP`, `SQUARE`, `ELEMENT_MUL`, `SCALAR_MUL/ADD/DIV`,
  `REDUCEMAX`, `REDUCESUM` and the `SOFTMAX` macro op were **removed** — they served a
  softmax/LayerNorm/GELU model and the current one is ReLU attention + DyT + ReLU FFN.
  Gone with them: both 256-entry activation ROMs, `rtl/luts/`, `accel/tpulang/luts.py`,
  the `GELU_INIT`/`EXP_INIT` parameters, the restoring divider, the softmax sequencer, the
  reduction path's **max fold** (`DOT` is the only reduction, so `acc` always opens at 0),
  `cfg vscalar`, and `examples/softmax_row.tpu` / `softmax_rows.tpu`. Measured by OOC
  synthesis of `vpu` alone: **10012 → 5162 LUTs (−48%), 897 → 667 FFs (−26%), 90 → 32 DSPs
  (−64%)**. Full table and what restoring softmax would cost: `accel/tpu/docs/vpu.md`
  §Removed ops.
  - **Retired opcodes are holes, not free space.** `0x02`, `0x05`, `0x0A`–`0x0F`, `0x1B`,
    `0x20` are not reallocated, so a stale binary decodes to an unknown op rather than a
    different one. Likewise `cfg` index 9 (`vscalar`) is vacant — renumbering 10–17 would
    silently repoint every `setcfg` in every program. `0x22` is now `tquant`; new ops go
    at `0x23`+.
  - **`vecdot` survives although no kernel issues it**: it is `vecmatmul`'s inner
    primitive, so the datapath is mandatory and the opcode costs one decode arm.
- **`tpu/`** — a SystemVerilog TPU running on a **Digilent Cmod A7-35T** (see
  `accel/tpu/README.md` and `accel/tpu/docs/`). The array, VPU, banked scratchpad, DMA +
  external SRAM, scalar unit and UART link are all synthesizable, and the design **fits**:
  `make bit` completes at 13342 LUTs of 20800 (64%), 7543 FFs, WNS +26.2 ns, timing met
  (measured 2026-08-17). The long-standing "857 LUTs over" note stopped reproducing — the
  MXU is 5930 LUTs post-route against the 14476 post-synth that note was written about, and
  nothing in the memory-path work touched it. `accel/tpu/docs/synth.md` §5 carries the
  current numbers beside the historical ones.
  `host/run_program.py`
  loads a program over UART, runs it, and checks the readback against both the ISS and PyTorch.
  Recent RTL work: `perf_counters.sv` (replaces `cycle_timer.sv`) and the **macro-op ISA**
  (`docs/macro_ops.md`) — phases 0–5 are *built and passing*: `setcfgr`, MXU config strides,
  `matmul_t` (hardware tile loop) and `vecmatmul`. Phase 5's hardware `softmax` was built,
  validated, and then **removed** (see the VPU note above); `layernorm` + the `rsqrt` LUT
  are not built and are now dropped — DyT replaced LayerNorm and needs no macro op. Still stubbed: the inter-TPU LINK (`wrneigh` is a completing no-op).
- **Dispatch is a 128-bit macro-op pushed into a per-unit queue, not a wire bundle
  plus a global config file.** `cmd_queue.sv` + `cmd_{mxu,vpu,dma}.sv` sit in front
  of each unit; a command carries its own operands and geometry, so nothing an
  earlier dispatch (or an earlier *program*) left in a register can reach it. Two
  producers push: `scalar_unit.sv` still runs tpulang and still waits after every
  dispatch — so **every `.tpu` program, `iss.py` and every golden vector is
  unchanged** — and `cpu_subsys.sv` (PicoRV32 + AXI4-Lite, `rtl/vendor/picorv32.v`)
  pushes the same commands from firmware. Firmware is `accel/tpu/fw/`: `tpu.h` is
  the MMIO aperture plus one builder per command, and the Makefile wants a
  bare-metal RISC-V gcc at **`-march=rv32ic_zmmul`** — *not* `rv32imc`, the core
  is built with `ENABLE_DIV(0)` and a `div` traps. Two C kernels, same
  `[8x32] @ [32x16]` problem and same addresses: `matmul.c` (one `matmul_t`, the
  array walks the 4x2 tile grid) and `matmul_loop.c` (the grid walked in C as 8
  single-tile dispatches, `.acc` across the contraction — the firmware analogue
  of `tiled_matmul.tpu` vs `tiled_matmul_hw.tpu`). `host/run_fw_matmul.py` loads
  either over `'I'` (word address bit 12 picks the CPU's RAM over IMEM) and
  checks the result; `make -C accel/tpu/fw PROG=matmul_loop` builds the second. Two more kernels
  exercise the rest of the machine: **`ffn.c`** (X@W1 -> relu -> requant -> @W2)
  is the first firmware to issue a **VPU** command at all, and **`mha.c`** (one
  head of ReLU attention) adds the **transposing DMA** and the `quant4` pack.
  Both pass through `make fw FWPROG=ffn|mha` and are checked against an
  independent Python reference as well as the ISS. **`tiled.c`** is the fifth and
  is written against `tpulib.h` rather than `tpu.h`: three DRAM-to-DRAM problems
  with an undersized arena, so the row, column and contraction loops all have to
  run (`make fw FWPROG=tiled`, 80 404 clocks, 237 commands).
  Both build with Homebrew `riscv64-elf-gcc` 16.2.0 and both **pass in
  simulation** — `cd accel/tpu/tb && make fw [FWPROG=matmul_loop]` runs the image
  out of `FW_INIT` through the whole core, 129 checks, 0 errors. **Not yet run on
  hardware.** `make fwsweep` walks the shape (both kernels take `M=`/`KTILES=`/
  `NTILES=` at build time) and measures the point of the exercise: the hardware
  tile walk costs the CPU **~380 clocks at every shape** (5 commands, flat over a
  205x range of array work), the C loop costs **~85 clocks per dispatch**, of
  which only `max(0, 85 − MXU-clocks-per-tile)` is exposed — zero once M > ~24.
  `docs/picorv32_migration.md` §9.6–9.7 carry the breakdown; §9.5 now also records
  that the `qfull` counter is **structurally 0** (both producers gate `cmd_we`
  with `!cmd_full`, so `p_cmd_we & p_cmd_full` never fires) and proves nothing.
  `docs/picorv32_migration.md` is the
  design record and carries the format table, the measured baseline and the phase
  plan; §0's table is what actually passes today. **Measured cost of the plane on
  the four-layer model: 690 705 → 693 107 clocks (+0.35%), byte-identical
  output.** Issue overhead went 6 914 → 9 229 clocks (1.00% → 1.33% of the run);
  the units gave back 1 536 of that (the requant literal), and the DMA's skid
  drain cost 1 622. None of the ~1.45x overlap is claimed yet — the scalar unit
  still waits after every dispatch, and `ovlap` reads 0.
  - **The requant `{m0,n}` is now a literal in the command**, not a scratchpad
    address. Same 16 bits either way, and it deleted a two-state fetch in both
    `mxu.sv` and `vpu.sv`. The scalar unit, whose ISA still names an *address*,
    reads the word over the S port before packing — a shim that exists only while
    tpulang is a producer.
  - **`scratchpad.sv`'s exclusivity invariant is gone.** It held only because
    issue-and-wait serialized the units; queues break it on purpose. Arbitration
    is now real, with grants (`V_rgnt`/`s_rgnt`/`dma_rgnt` and the write pair),
    ordered so the requester that cannot stall wins: reads `A>W>C>V>s>DMA`,
    writes `C>V>s>DMA`. The VPU freezes its FSM for a clock when denied; the DMA
    parks fill bytes in a skid buffer and, past that, stops the SRAM read stream
    through `sram.sv`'s new `dout_ready`. **If you make two units run at once,
    check every path into the scratchpad takes its grant back** — a denied
    requester that ignores it loses the access silently.
  - **`swait` stopped meaning "control overhead"** once dispatch went through
    queues. The counter block is 10 wide now: 0–6 unchanged (so the UART `'T'`
    reply stays prefix-compatible), plus `idlec` (clocks with *no* unit busy —
    this is what instruction overhead costs), `qfull` and `ovlap`. Under the
    scalar unit `ovlap` and `qfull` are identically 0, which is the check that
    the command plane is in the path and not yet changing behaviour.
- **`sram.sv` moves ranges, not bytes.** One request is a start address, a byte count and an
  address stride; `dma.sv` issues one range per source row (in linear mode, one for the whole
  transfer) and streams it. **1 clock/byte on fills, 2 on spills**, against ~8 before, and the
  full adder model through `tb/tpu_top_tb.sv` went **1 226 722 → 541 590 clocks (2.27x)** with
  byte-identical output — DMA fell from 66% of the run to 24%. Two things to know before
  touching it: writes are two clocks because **WE# is generated on the falling edge**, so its
  rising edge lands half a clock clear of the address/data change (the chip's address hold is
  0 ns, i.e. met by skew alone if you drive it from the rising edge — the failure mode is a
  byte written to its *neighbour*, and both `sram_tb` and `dma_tb` now check for it); and the
  `stride` exists for `wrmem.t`, whose destination is column-major and would otherwise be one
  range per byte. `CLOCKS_PER_ACCESS` is now *extra* clocks per beat and is 0 on every board.
  `accel/tpu/docs/dma.md` §7 and `rtl/sram.sv`'s header are the full story.
- **19-bit DRAM addressing from programs.** `scalar_unit.sv` used to truncate a `rdmem`/`wrmem`
  DRAM address to 16 bits, so a *program* could only reach the low 64 KB of the 512 KB SRAM even
  though the host always could. Widening it to `MEM_ADDR_W = 19` is what let the 96 KB of model
  weights stay resident. It broke three things that were invisible while both widths agreed
  below 64 KB, all documented in `accel/tpulang/adder_kernel.md` §2: `li` had to stop
  sign-extending, the testbenches' DRAM byte maps were sized off `ADDR_W` (so high expectations
  were *silently dropped* by `$readmemh`), and `tpu_top_tb`'s backdoor pokes truncated too.
  **When something addresses DRAM, check it is not using `ADDR_W`.**
- **`tpulang/`** — three files, all that is left of the software stack after the
  assembler and the `.tpu` language were deleted. `iss.py` (bit-exact with the RTL;
  the instruction decoder is gone, `exec_command`/`run_trace` are the way in),
  `fw_vectors.py` (a firmware kernel's command trace → golden DRAM images + the
  expected command stream, plus the **one** definition of each kernel's synthetic
  operands), and `adder_export.py` (real checkpoint → requant table → trace →
  accuracy). The directory name is now a fossil.
- **`fw/tpulib.h` is the primitive layer, and it is written to be specialized.**
  `tpu_matmul` blocks a GEMM in rows (`t_len <= 32`), columns and the contraction,
  stages whichever operands are in DRAM through a caller-supplied `tpu_arena`,
  and requants on store when the contraction was unsplit or through the VPU when
  it was not; `tpu_add_narrow` / `tpu_relu_narrow` / `tpu_pack4` chunk the VPU
  pairs at `vlen` and stream DRAM operands; `tpu_transpose8` and `tpu_move2d`
  cover the rest. Every primitive is **self-fencing** — it returns only once its
  commands have retired — so composing two is always safe.
  - **`tpu_matmul`, `tpu_gemm_blocks` and `tpu_gemm_need` are `always_inline`,
    and that is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** Everything a primitive computes
    before its first push is exposed clock for clock (the caller has just
    fenced) and the PicoRV32 is ~5-9 clocks per instruction with no cache, so
    ~200 instructions of block arithmetic per matmul costs more than the array
    spends on the dispatch. With the shape constant at the call site gcc folds
    the chooser, the loops and every staging branch away; without the fold the
    same kernel runs **597 936 clocks instead of 453 778** and the image is
    *larger*. Measured three ways in `docs/picorv32_migration.md` §9.10. If you
    add a firmware abstraction, check the disassembly, not the command count.
  - `fw/tiled.c` is the regression for the block loops themselves: DRAM to DRAM,
    an arena of a few hundred bytes, and `fw_vectors.py::reference_tiled`
    checking the ISS against a plain Python matmul — because a mis-tiled matmul
    is something the ISS would reproduce as faithfully as the RTL.
- **`fw/adder.c` is not an example — it is the whole shipped model** (four layers
  + the output head) in **534 commands and 1992 bytes**, one program, one run,
  composed out of `tpulib.h`. `LAYERS` is the only thing that moves when the
  model's depth changes. Its byte-level contract — DRAM/scratchpad maps, the 16
  requant `{m0,n}` words per layer, the row-major int4 packing, why K is
  transposed and V is not — is that file's header and
  `accel/tpu/fw/README.md`. Read those before touching the kernel or the host
  staging. `Wq`/`Wk`/`Wv` are **three dense `[D][D]` DRAM blocks**, not one
  fused `[D][3D]` one: fusing the fill was free when the kernel staged its own
  weights, and under `tpu_matmul` a column slice of a fused block is strided and
  would cost D transfers.
  - **The requant table is a compile-time input**, because the `{m0,n}` word is a
    literal in the macro-op and the CPU has no path to DRAM or the scratchpad.
    `fw/adder_rq.h` is the checked-in default and is tuned for `fw_vectors.py`'s
    synthetic operands, so the RTL regression needs no checkpoint;
    `adder_export.py` generates a real one and compiles the kernel against it
    with `-DADDER_RQ_H`.

When touching attention numerics, keep the implementations in sync:
`model/transformer.py` (reference), `fw/adder.c` + `iss.py`, and the RTL.

## The int8 finding, and why the model keeps changing

> **The numbers in this section describe the architecture *before* ternary K/V.**
> `model/saved/ternary_mha.pt` was fitted with int8 K and V, a positional encoding and
> `vecmatmul` attention; it has no `q_kt`/`q_vt` and its weights never saw a ternary K,
> so `adder_export.py` on it no longer measures the shipped kernel. **The model needs
> retraining** before rows 8-10 of `adder_kernel.md` §7 can be repeated, and the ternary
> config that would train it no longer exists — see the note at the top of this file.
> `QATCalibration` now falls back to the
> calibration set for any site whose `ActQuant.initialized` flag is clear, so a stale
> checkpoint degrades rather than silently quantizing with a scale of 1.0. Everything
> below about *why* PTQ fails here is unaffected by the change.

**Resolved on the `qat` branch: train through the quantizers and the same kernel scores
100.00% exact-sequence / 100.00% token** (`adder_export.py -n 256 -c 128 --iss-check` on
`model/saved/ternary_mha.pt`, ISS cross-check 0/416 logits differ; `adder_kernel.md` §7.6c).
Nothing in the kernel changed *at that point* — it was byte-identical to the one that scored
0.00% below; the ternary-K/V rewrite came after. What
changed is that every requant site is an `ActQuant` present during training with an LSQ-learned
scale, so the clipping is part of the fitted function rather than damage inflicted afterwards.

Three consequences worth internalizing before reading the PTQ history below:

- **The "float" row is no longer a ceiling.** Removing the quantizers from a QAT checkpoint
  gives 0.00% — a network the weights were never trained for, not the model's true accuracy.
  `quant.benchmark` disables the sites explicitly for that row; `--fake-quant` (same scheme in
  float32) is the honest cross-check, and it also scores 100.00%.
- **Saturation rates stopped being a health check.** L0's `RQ_O` word is `3838/2^3` = 479.75 and
  clips **99.88%** of `O` — the layer learned to use the requant as a `sign()`. `report_clips`
  localizes damage only for a PTQ checkpoint.
- **Scales come from the checkpoint, not from calibration.** `quant.QATCalibration` reads the
  learned `ActQuant.scale` (`--scales qat|calib|auto`). Re-deriving by absmax moves every
  rounding grid the weights were fitted against, so it is not a neutral substitution — the
  control is `--scales calib` on the *same* QAT checkpoint, which scores **0.00%**. It takes
  `.abs()`: LSQ can drive a scale negative and `ActQuant.forward` uses the magnitude.

The rest of this section is the **post-training** quantization history. It is still correct
about those checkpoints, and its account of the `vecadd`-single-scale constraint is still what
forces `RQ_O` to be pinned — but it is no longer the live problem.

**The kernel is correct and the PTQ checkpoints are not int8-quantizable.** On
`colab_ternary_mha_small_nobias.pt`, via `adder_export.py -n 256 -c 128 --iss-check`:

| | exact-sequence | token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| float model | **96.09%** | 99.76% |
| int8 activations, this kernel | **0.00%** | 63.23% |

The ISS cross-check passed (0 of 416 logits differ against the independent reference on those
very weights), so this measures the kernel, not a model of it. **Do not go looking for a bug in
the kernel, the calibration, or the requant words** (worst relative error 0.87%). The cause was
established four ways in `adder_kernel.md` §7.6:

1. Fake-quantizing in pure float reproduces it — nothing integer-specific is involved.
2. Any single quantization site is fatal alone (`X1` → 0.00%, Q/K/V → 3.12%, `A` → 1.56%).
3. The model tolerates ±10% *multiplicative* jitter everywhere at 100% exact-sequence, i.e.
   100× more error than int8 injects. It is not fragile to perturbation in general.
4. Quantization error is *absolute*, and a per-tensor scale is pinned by the maximum — so what
   matters is `median/max`, and with no normalization that collapses with depth: 1.3% of layer
   0's residual stream rounds to exactly zero, 91.6% of layer 3's `A` does. The usual outlier
   check misses it because the *top* of the distribution is well behaved (`max/p99.9` ≈ 1.1–2.5).

The remedy looked like per-channel/per-token activation scales, **which this ISA cannot
express** (`requant` takes one `{m0,n}` per dispatch; `matmul_t.rq` reads one `cfg scalar`) — so
the options were: retrain with normalization (`tpunn.md` §1 measured 98.4% with LayerNorm), or
add a per-channel requant path to the VPU. The `no-layernorm` branch tried the first with DyT
(one multiply + a clamp, which the VPU already does); that fixed the diagnosed mechanism and
still scored 0.00%, because what it exposed was the residual *addend* — `vecadd` puts `X` and
`O = Wo(A)` on one scale while they differ by up to 7259× (`adder_kernel.md` §7.6b).

**QAT is the third option and it needs no VPU change at all**: rather than finding scales the
trained weights tolerate, it trains weights that tolerate the scales. That is what the `qat`
branch did, and it is why the header above supersedes this analysis.

Related, from tuning the synthetic requant words: moving `RQ_A` by two shifts (`{1,6}`→`{1,8}`)
took `A` from 45% saturated at ±127 to 99.3% *exactly zero*. Each layer's requant multiplies the
residual stream by a constant, so an error compounds geometrically with nothing renormalizing it.

## Stale docs

Several docs describe an earlier model or ISA. When they disagree with the code, the code wins;
fix the doc if you are in there anyway.

- **`model/README.md`** — the most stale. Describes LayerNorm/post-LN, softmax attention, GELU
  in the FFN, sinusoidal positional encoding, `mha_torch`/`slow_mha_cuda`, MoE, `f=512` for the
  ternary config, and the deleted vanilla/GQA/`colab_ternary_mha` checkpoints. Its *invariants* sections (`EQUALS_POS`, the
  sampling, the `TernaryLinear` weight orientation, the double residual) are still correct.
- **`accel/tpulang/tpunn.md`** — superseded by `adder_kernel.md`; written against the older
  model (LayerNorm, GELU, softmax, biases, `f=512`) and the pre-macro-op ISA. Still the only
  record of the 98.4% ternary+int8 number quoted above.
  It additionally describes the `gelu`/`exp` LUTs and `luts.py`, all now deleted.
- **`accel/tpu/docs/README.md`** — fixed for the VPU trim, but its own §1/§4 still carry a
  "the component doc wins" caveat; `docs/vpu.md` is authoritative on the op set.

## Solved: intermittent UART corruption (root-caused 2026-08-07)

**The fault was on the host, not the FPGA. Reading the serial port while the USB-serial
bridge is still transmitting corrupts the byte in flight.** The host's IN requests disturb
the FT2232H's transmit bit timing by roughly half a bit, so the device samples that byte on
its bit boundaries and decodes `sent[k]` **or** `sent[k-1]` for every bit `k` — usually
`value << 1`, sometimes `value | (value << 1)`. Fixed in `host/tpu_uart.py`: `TPUUart._send`
now waits for a frame to clear the wire before anything reads (see that docstring and
`TX_SETTLE_S` / `TX_RATE_SLACK`). All four commands and `test_uart_link.py`'s `raw_exchange`
route through it.

`tpu_uart.py` had always issued `ser.write(frame)` then read the reply immediately, so the
read landed on the *first few bytes of every command* — i.e. the header, where a corrupted
length or address does the most damage. A 16-bit length field arriving one bit left-shifted
is the whole of the original symptom: the device really did read 0x0180 bytes when asked for
0x0140, so "the device sent more bytes than the host asked for" was literal, not a desync
artefact.

**How it was pinned down**, on the echo image (`cmod_a7_echo` reports every byte it received,
so no protocol can hide anything), 64-byte bursts, 6400 bytes per arm:

| host behaviour | corrupted | positions in the burst |
|---|---|---|
| read immediately after write | 72/6400 | 1–6 |
| sleep past the whole burst, then read | **0/6400** | — |
| sleep over only the *first half*, then read | 77/6400 | **33–46** |

The third row is the proof: delaying the read moves the damage to exactly where the read
begins. It is not a probability spread over the burst — it is one mangled byte per burst,
located wherever the host started reading.

**Ruled out — do not re-litigate.** Each cost a real experiment:

| Hypothesis | Killed by |
|---|---|
| Anything in the RTL | `uart_receiver` alone, and the whole `uart_memory` path, decode a bit-exact back-to-back stream perfectly at the real 104.1667 clocks/bit — all 256 byte values, 40 frames. See "the simulation blind spot" below |
| `uart_interface`'s `SEND_STATUS` blind window | Co-simulation passes identically with and without the `rx_hold` fix; `rx_overrun`/`collision` never set on hardware either |
| External SRAM, `sram_controller`, the 30 bank-14 pins, SSO | `cmod_a7_bram` (on-chip BRAM, no SRAM chip, no SRAM pins) reproduces at 23.8% vs 27.5% — indistinguishable |
| Byte value, and the byte before it on the wire | 0x40 corrupts 15.8% in a header slot and 0/5184 in a payload slot; sweeping the predecessor over 0x00/0x01/0x03/0x0f/0x40/0xff changes nothing |
| Position in the burst per se | The damage tracks the *read*, not the offset — see the table above |
| Baud mismatch / sampling phase | Host baud swept 108k–122k: flat 12–30% across ±3%, so no phase minimum. Device sample points are within 1.5 clocks of centre by construction |
| Long low runs on the line, DC/slew recovery | Corruption rate is flat as the predecessor's low run goes 9 → 4 bit times |
| The `activity` LED's load step | Flat ~1.1% at every inter-burst idle from 0 ms to 200 ms, including idles shorter than the LED's 43.7 ms hold |
| `reset_input_buffer()` (PurgeComm) perturbing the bridge | With it, without it, and with it 20 ms early: all ~1.1% |
| Metastability, TX→RX crosstalk, timing closure | Previously ruled out; nothing since contradicts them |

**The simulation blind spot, now fixed in understanding.** `tb/uart_memory_cosim_tb.sv`'s
`drive_byte` clocks every bit for exactly `CPB` clocks, so its host is bit-exact with the
device and has *zero* baud error — a real 115200 host against a 12 MHz CPB=104 device runs at
104.1667. That is why `make cosim` could never see this, and it is worth remembering before
trusting a green co-simulation run about anything analogue or timing-related. Driving the same
RTL at a fractional bit period (accumulator carrying the remainder across bits and bytes) is
still clean, which is what exonerated the RTL.

**Still worth doing.** `UART_RX_TIMEOUT = 0` is what turns one corrupted byte into a
permanently wedged link: the FSM sits mid-frame forever and only a reflash clears it, which
is why a single failure used to cascade into every later test in the suite. Setting it to
`20 * UART_CPB` in `boards/*/board.tcl` makes a corrupted frame cost one legible timeout
instead. That is hardening, not the fix — the fix is in the host — but the link should not
depend on the host never glitching. Measured floor is one byte time; at `200` clocks (~2 bit
times) the abort fires mid-frame during ordinary streaming and every command NAKs.

See `docs/uart_selftest.md` for the echo self-test (`make echo`, `board=cmod_a7_echo`,
`host/uart_echo.py`). **Reflash `board=cmod_a7` before running `test_uart_link.py` or
`run_program.py`** — they time out against the echo bitstream. Note that bitstreams under
`synth/build/` are not rebuilt by `mode=program`; check their mtime against `rtl/` before
concluding anything from a board run.

## Long simulations

A full-model run is `make fw FWPROG=adder` in `accel/tpu/tb`: **453 778 clocks**, about
**3 minutes** of Icarus, 526 959 checks. It regenerates the golden vectors from the
kernel's own native trace first, so a stale image cannot silently be compared against
the wrong expectations. `fw_matmul_tb.sv` does not dump a VCD at all, and the tb
Makefile already passes the kernel a 60 ms watchdog (the 2 ms default is sized for the
small kernels and would trip on this one while it worked perfectly).

The split is `mxu = 206 361`, `dma = 131 200`, `vpu = 84 352`, `idlec = 31 864` (7.0%,
which is what the CPU costs as a command producer). `qfull` and `ovlap` are both 0:
nothing overlaps yet, because every primitive fences after every cross-unit dependency.

**`make fwtime FWPROG=<kernel>` is the same run plus a per-command timeline** —
`fw_matmul_tb.sv` dumps one with `+CMDLOG=`, `tb/cmd_timeline.py` turns it into
per-unit, per-phase and per-command-class tables, and the two columns it uses
reconstruct the perf counters exactly (the tool checks that every run). Two things
it found that the totals hide: **moving weights (98 400 DMA clocks, 23.2%) costs
more than either FFN matmul**, and **82% of the CPU's time is the `tpu_wait`
barriers, not building commands** — a command pushed onto a busy unit costs 13.3
exposed clocks, one after a barrier costs 183.6, and 64 of the 143 barriers are the
fence in the per-head attention loop. `docs/picorv32_migration.md` §9.9-§9.10.

For an edit-run loop, use the **ISS** rather than the RTL — one four-layer forward is
**1.9 s**, so `python accel/tpulang/adder_export.py -n 4` is a ~10 s check that the
kernel still computes the model. The RTL run is what proves the *hardware* agrees; it
is not where you iterate. `make fw FWPROG=ffn` (or `mha`) is the ~5 s smoke test that
the dispatch plane still works at all.

**A long Icarus run prints nothing until it halts, which makes "slow" and "deadlocked"
look identical from outside.** Redirect the log to a file rather than piping it through
`tail`/`head`, which buffer the whole stream.
